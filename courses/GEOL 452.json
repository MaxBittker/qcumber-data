Other techniques including Mossbauer,\u00a0 infra-red spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy will also be covered. An extensive term project is required where the student employs these techniques to study a material of their choice. \r\nNOTE\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This course may not be offered every year.
