        "description": "Application of fundamental chemistry principles with respect to their sources, reactions, effects and fates in civil and environmental engineering systems. Topics will include chemical equilibria, stoichiometry and reaction kinetics; electrochemistry and corrosion; adsorption and ion exchange; solubility and precipitation; coagulation; microbiological reactions and kinetics; biochemical, chemical and theoretical oxygen demand; acidity, alkalinity and hardness; as well as biogeochemical cycles. These concepts will be further developed and applied in tutorial and laboratory modules. A design-based laboratory is conducted as part of this course.PPE will be required for this course at student\u00bfs cost (see course materials for details).",
