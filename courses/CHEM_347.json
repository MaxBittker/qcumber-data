        "description": "The course covers four major topics. 1. The thermodynamic properties of interfaces (surface energy, wetting, surface area and porosity, capillary effects, work of adhesion/cohesion). 2. Models of adsorption/desorption phenomena.\u00a03. The dynamics of phase transitions (meta-stability, nucleation, spinoidal decomposition). 4. The stability and characterization of colloidal systems. Student appreciation for the importance of these phenomena is cultivated using examples drawn from industrial processes/products including inks, paints, foods, polymer blends, and nanocomposites.\nLEARNING HOURS\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 120 (36L;12T;72P)",
