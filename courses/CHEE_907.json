Only topics not covered in other graduate courses will be included. Topics will vary depending on the instructor(s).\r\n \nGas-Solid Reactions\r\nThis course will focus on thermodynamics and kinetics for gas-solid reactions. The main focus of the course will be understanding what information quantum chemistry (density functional theory or DFT) computations yield and how to build thermodynamic functions and kinetic models using DFT-generated energetics.
