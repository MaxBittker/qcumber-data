        "description": "International economic law governs what nations may do to channel, encourage and restrict the flow of goods, services, capital and people across borders. The rules of international economic law thereby affect important aspects of all our lives -how much we pay for the products that we purchase, what types of employment are open to us, and which medicines we can access. This course offers an introduction into the basic rules and core concepts of international economic law. We will focus on the law of the World Trade Organization and the rules on investment in Chapter 11 of the NAFTA, as well as the provisions of the recently negotiated trade agreement between the Canada and the European Union. We will consider questions such as: Should Canada be able to protect its renewable energy industry against foreign competition? Should the European Union be allowed to ban imports of seal products to protect the moral sensibilities of its citizens? And should foreign corporations be able to sue governments for damages if legislation adversely affects the profitability of their investments?",
