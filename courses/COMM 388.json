        "description": "Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) has been defined as \"a discipline concerned with the design, evaluation, and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use and with the study of major phenomena surrounding them\". In this course, we\u00a0survey the various components and techniques of HCI. Starting with some basic capabilities of people, we: look at the design of everyday objects to motivate the design of computer interfaces; explore various techniques for bringing users into the design loop as we learn about basic user interface design tools; and study evaluation techniques to help understand if our designs are effective. We\u00a0examine the implications of HCI for a variety of business applications (e.g.: electronic commerce, computer-supported cooperative work, and employee training).",
