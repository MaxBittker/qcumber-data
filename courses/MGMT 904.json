Students will work with various data sets and gain insight into the use of the structural equation model with specific applications in regression, factor analysis, canonical correlation, discriminant analysis, simultaneous equation systems, analysis of covariance, and multivariate analysis of variance. Other multivariate procedures will be reviewed as time permits.",
