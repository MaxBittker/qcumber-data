        "description": "This course provides an in-depth examination of selected topics in colloids of great interest to sciences and technology, such as emulsion stability, adsorption, particles electrokinetics and light scattering. In-class discussions and presentations, literature reviews, and individual projects, will provide graduate students with the solid fundamental knowledge and critical thinking required to approach problems related to these phenomena in a rigorous manner. This is not intended to be an introductory course in Colloids. Prior knowledge of Colloids and Surface Science principles is required. \r\nPrerequisites: ENCH 460, or CHEE 909 or other introductory course in Colloids, or permission of instructor.",
