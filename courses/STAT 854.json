Because most of the common time--domain methods are unreliable, the emphasis is on frequency--domain methods, i.e. methods that work and expose the bias that plagues most time--domain techniques.\u00a0 Slepian sequences (discrete prolate spheroidal sequences) and multi--taper methods of spectrum estimation are covered in detail.\u00a0(Offered jointly with STAT 454*.)Three term-hours, fall; lectures.",
