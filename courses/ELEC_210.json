        "description": "An introductory course for engineering students in disciplines other than electrical or computer engineering. The course begins with a review of the concepts of resistance, capacitance, and inductance. Circuit analysis techniques are then applied to characterize the behaviour of commonly used electrical energy conversion devices such as transformers, dc machines, and induction and synchronous machines.",
