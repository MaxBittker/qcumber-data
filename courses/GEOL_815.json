Topics may include flow concepts applied to ductile deformation, description and interpretation of microstructural fabrics, subduction processes, fluid and faulting, modelling approaches to Tectonic problems, and exhumation processes of metamorphic rocks. Far field effects such as lithosphere rheology, climate, and erosion will also be discussed.",
