For example, candidates may choose to do a series of half-days, or two full-time weeks, or a combination of half-days, full-days and/or full weeks. Full-time weeks may be done during the fall or winter reading weeks, or (if necessary) at the end of the term in May, or a reasonable combination of these options.\u00a0 The placement must be completed in the same academic year.",
