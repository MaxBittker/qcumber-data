        "description": "An introductory course on wind-turbine operation and aerodynamics. Topics include: the Betz limit; the Blade Element Momentum method; characteristics of the atmospheric boundary layer; unsteady aerodynamic theory; gusts and blade aeroelasticity; blade noise and health effects; and wind-park siting and planning. Extension of some of these topics to small wind turbines, run-of-the-river water turbines and off-grid systems will also be presented. Students are expected to have sufficient experience with fluid dynamics equivalent to MECH 341. Those who have not taken such a course will need to prepare through self-study.",
