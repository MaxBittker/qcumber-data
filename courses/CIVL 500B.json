        "description": "Working closely with a faculty member, students will conduct research on a civil engineering or related applied science topic. Students will: identify a problem; formulate a research question; and devise and implement a research plan. The nature of the research may involve obtaining experimental measurements, performing field testing and/or numerical analysis, and analysing and interpreting research results. Students will prepare a comprehensive, written technical report and will defend their research in an oral examination. Registration is limited to a maximum of twenty (20) students. (PPE will be required for this course at student's cost (see course materials for details).",
