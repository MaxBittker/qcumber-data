        "description": "This fourth year design capstone course has student teams undertake a comprehensive engineering design project which involves the creative, interactive process of designing a structure/system to meet a specified need subject to economic, health, safety and environmental constraints. The teams will work in collaboration with an industry partner. Each team will submit an engineering report and make an oral presentation.\u00a0 PPE will be required for this course at student's cost (see course materials for details).\u00a0\u00a0 * APSC 480 will be considered as a substitute for CIVL 400 and CIVL 460",
