The intention of this course is to develop in students a critical awareness of the social construction of policy, of intended and contingent impacts of policy, and of the components constituting the policy cycle. The process of policy-making will be explored using various perspectives and understandings of the phases of policy development, implementation, and evaluation. Fall; B. Kutsyuruba.",
