        "description": "This course focusses on practical measurement systems for Masters student's in mechanical engineering.\u00a0 On completing this course students will be able to: Select, install, test, and program a micro controller system for data acquisition and control; Select, analyze the performance of, and apply transducers for temperature; pressure; stress, strain and force; position, velocity and acceleration; Apply basic signal conditioning in analog and digital domains; Analyze data to draw conclusions from measurements and uncertainty analysis. Conceive, Design, Implement and Operate a complete measurement system as part of a course project. The course will require a small equipment expenditure (< $100 / student) for components that will be reusable in subsequent years.",
