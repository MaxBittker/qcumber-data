This course will examine consumers and their consumption behaviours and practices as social and cultural phenomena as opposed to economic or psychological phenomena. By examining the relationship between consumers, the market place and cultural meaning, this course will cover the macro, interpretive, and cultural approaches found in Consumer Culture Theory research",
