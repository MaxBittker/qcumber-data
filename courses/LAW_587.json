        "description": "The Queen's Law Journal is a refereed periodical devoted to the advancement of legal scholarship. Published twice annually, the Journal contains articles by academics, practitioners, judges, and some exceptionally high-quality student writing. The Journal offers training and experience in legal research, critical analysis, and precise writing. The Journal is managed and edited by a board of student editors under the supervision of a faculty advisor. The editorial board is directed by six senior editors: the editor-in-chief, the managing editor, the planning editor, the production editor, the articles editor, and the submissions editor. Twelve additional students round out the editorial board. Editors are chosen for their academic excellence, relevant experience, and writing ability. The editor-in-chief receives 6 credits (LAW-589), the other senior editors receive 6 credits (LAW-588) and the associate editors receive 4 credits (LAW-587) upon successful performance of editorial and production duties. Editorial positions with academic credit are open only to second and third year J.D. students and to LL.M. students, but first year J.D. students are encouraged to become involved to familiarize themselves with the Journal.
