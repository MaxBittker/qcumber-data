        "description": "This course will offer an in-depth analysis of select topics in constitutional law. We will focus mostly on the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms but may also discuss matters pertaining to other parts of the Constitution. The course will be advanced, as compared to the basic first year constitutional law, in two ways. First, it will allow an analysis, beyond what is possible in the first year constitutional law class, of Charter rights addressed in first year (such as ss. 2, 7 and 15). Second, it will give students an opportunity to learn about constitutional provisions not addressed in first year at all (such as ss. 2(d) and 23). We are very fortunate to live in an era in which the Supreme Court produces many important constitutional decisions every year - in the past two years alone, the Court has revised previous decisions on fundamental issues such as assisted suicide, the right to strike, the definition of discrimination, and regulation of prostitution. In other new cases, even though the Court did not fully revise its course, it added - sometimes deliberately, sometime unintentionally - layers of analysis to other constitutional doctrine. The course will take advantage of this wonderful plethora of decisions, and put special emphasis on new decisions and the way they interact with old ones.",
