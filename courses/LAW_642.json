        "description": "This seminar explores areas of civil liability that create specific and unique complexities for lawyers and litigants alike. The course combines topics in tort, insurance, and civil litigation and concentrates on the intersections of these areas to synthesize both a coherent system of redress and a system for organizing social behaviour. The course deals with the tough cases and attempts to dissect what makes a tough case tough. Topics to be covered include causation and proof problems in negligence law, multi-party litigation and liability apportionment issues, insurance as a compensation web (liability, first party, and government insurance), fact-finding and evidentiary concerns including public inquiries and inquests, complex liability in human-made and natural disasters like 9/11 and hurricanes, mass transportation litigation (trains and planes), concurrent liability theories (i.e. tort and contract), and litigation settlement dynamics.3 credits, winter termProfessor Knutsen",
