Basic ideas of game theory, including Nash equilibrium\u00a0and mixed strategies; stability using approaches developed for the study of dynamical systems, including evolutionary stability and replicator dynamics; the emergence of co-operative behaviour; limitations of applying the theory to human behaviour.\nLEARNING HOURS\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 120 (36L;84P)\nRECOMMENDATION\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MATH 110/6.0 or MATH 111/6.0.",
