Students obtain an integrated overview of the nature and operation of the Earth-surface environment. Topics include origin of sedimentary rocks and their sedimentary structures, depositional environments and stratigraphic successions; stratigraphic principles and their application to sedimentary basins, with implications for hydrocarbon genesis; interaction of natural processes with human society.",
