        "description": "This course introduces students to key texts that have shaped the field of Cultural Studies over time, among them works by Raymond Williams, Richard Hoggart, Stuart Hall and the Birmingham Centre, Tony Bennett, Meaghan Morris, Ien Ang, Will Straw, Angela McRobbie and Kuan-Hsing Chen. Interrogation of the field through its literature also involves consideration of the international migration of Cultural Studies, as well its points of containment and limitations; its engagement with text and evidence from a wide variety sources, and thus its relationship to both disciplinary and interdisciplinary study; and its identification of concepts central to the field, chief among them culture itself. For this reason, the course also sets out to read the literature of Cultural Studies against other literatures in relation to which it defines itself, including that devoted to post colonial studies and interdisciplinarity.
