        "description": "This course provides an understanding of the social, cultural, emotional, motivational and environmental factors that influence student behaviour and development, instructional strategies and curriculum adaptations that promote self-esteem, autonomy and self-regulation. Additionally, creating conditions that promote and maintain a positive, safe, inclusive and healthy school culture and climate will be explored. Moving from a traditional behavourist approach to one that highlights the relationship between behaviour and learning are crucial. Through an understanding of community building strategies, effective classroom management, developing a school-wide positive behaviour support plan will also be addressed throughout the course.",
