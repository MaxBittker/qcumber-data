        "description": "This course is designed to combine theories of mass transfer, consolidation and microstructural development in particulate materials. Specifically, the concept of neck formation, the driving force for sintering and mechanisms of sintering will be discussed and applied to specific systems. Solid state, liquid phase and reaction sintering will be covered along with recent examples of sintering in oxide, carbide and nitride ceramics. Three term-hours.",
