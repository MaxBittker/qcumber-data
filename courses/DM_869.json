Engineering and scientific know-how are given added power when communicated with clarity and simplicity in presentations that are thoughtfully planned and effectively executed. This is a theoretically-based hands-on course. Students will be able to develop a wide range of skills including making several, short presentations by capturing the essence of complex technical subject using data, key words and images. By the end of the course, students will be able to develop a wide range of skills in connecting with an audience and achieving the desired impact.
