Tectonic setting, age, rock composition, geometry, mineralogy and textures, geochemical and geophysical signatures. Metallogenic epochs and provinces. Design and evaluation of ore deposit models and exploration programs, including ore processing and environmental issues. Laboratory work integrates techniques of ore microscopy to determine paragenetic sequences, estimation of ore grade and evaluation of issues related to ore processing and site contamination.\nLEARNING HOURS\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 121 (33L;33Lb;55P)",
