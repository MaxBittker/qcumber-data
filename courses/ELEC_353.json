        "description": "Transistor-level modeling and design of analog and digital electronic circuits. Differential amplifiers, current mirrors, multi-stage amplifiers, frequency response of amplifiers, high-frequency transistor models, feedback amplifier configurations, two-port networks, CMOS logic gates. Students learn the basics of computer aided design (CAD) of integrated circuits including schematic simulation, layout, design rules, layout versus schematic verification and extracted circuit simulation. Laboratory work is design oriented and complements the lecture material.",
