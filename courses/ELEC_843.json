Topics include: basic automata and language theory; modeling of processes using automata (finite-state machines, directed graphs);\u00a0centralized and decentralized problems; nonblocking supervisors; partial observation; and computational complexity. Connections with manufacturing systems and communication protocols are emphasized. Three term-hours; lectures, Fall. K. Rudie",
