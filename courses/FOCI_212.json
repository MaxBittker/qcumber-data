Workshops, placements, upgrading courses and other such venues can also be negotiated with the course instructor. An introduction to (a) the Technology Skills Profile used to track the range and level of skills and (b) individual requirements/program for completion of the Technology Skills Profile.\u00a0Course expectations reflect the Standards of Practice for the teaching profession described by the Ontario College of Teachers. \u00a0",
