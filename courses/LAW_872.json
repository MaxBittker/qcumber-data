        "description": "The twentieth century saw a rise in the creation of global or multinational econo-financial structures intended to govern or regulate econo-financial relations between nations. These include, among others, the International Monetary fund (IMF); the IBRD or World Bank, the European Community; and the various bodies of the United Nations such as the United Nations Conference on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL). There has also been a growth of global non-state structures or organizations such as the International Swap Dealers Association (ISDA) and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) that provide guidelines for its members. These efforts towards the international or global regulation of interstate econo-financial activity has given rise to a number of legal regimes or bodies of law that regulate international financial activity. The course, International Financial Regulation, will examine some of these legal regimes, and how they affect international financial transactions. Topics to be discussed include, the 1) Law of Electronic Funds Transfers; 2) Law of Swap Transactions; 3) Financing of International Trade; and 4) Law governing international or offshore bank deposit transactions.\u00a0 (To be offered jointly with LAW-544.)
