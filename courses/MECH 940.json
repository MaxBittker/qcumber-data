Topics can be selected from the general areas of heat transfer, fluid mechanics and thermodynamics. The course will include lectures, open discussions and directed study. The course content for a student or group must be specified in writing at the beginning of the course and cannot be the same as their thesis research topic. The course mark will be based on reports and presentations by each student. Three term hours, lectures.\u00a0 A.M. Birk",
