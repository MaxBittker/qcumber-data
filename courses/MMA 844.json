        "description": "Effective project management requires a skill set and leadership that, together, deliver discipline in planning, organizing, and managing resources to execute projects that meet strategic goals and objectives.\u00a0 Accordingly, this course takes a dual-pronged approach and covers concepts in the four basic functions of project management (planning, organizing, directing, and controlling), but does it from a leadership perspective.\u00a0 A core focus in the course is learning how to create and drive an effective project environment within a company culture.\u00a0 What can we do as leaders to ensure the organization launches and delivers projects well every time?\r\nThe course provides students with twenty-three instructional hours, which they can apply to certification requirements for either a Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM), or (with additional training) a Project Management Professional (PMP) with the Project Management Institute (PMI).",
