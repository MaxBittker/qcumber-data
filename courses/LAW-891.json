        "description": "The interaction between economics and law has provided a theoretical perspective that has significantly influenced the way that law is conceptualized and analyzed. The tools of economic analysis also provide one means of critically examining the way that law functions and thinking about how we might want to design laws to better achieve the social objectives that underpin them. This course will involve both study and critique of the law and economics approach to legal theory and legal analysis. Three term-hours; Fall. C. Metcalf.",
