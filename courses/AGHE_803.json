Attention is placed on the underlying demographic factors and socio-economic characteristics of population aging and how issues like fertility, mortality, morbidity, life expectancy, mobility and immigration are changing the demography of the older population in Canada and internationally. Emphasis is also placed on how demographic and socio-economic characteristics of population aging result in complex and uneven geographies of aging at various scales from neighbourhood to international comparisons.",
