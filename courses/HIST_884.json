        "description": "Since 1901 the Nobel Prize has been the ultimate certificate of major contributions in medical science. Yet, some Nobel achievements are now viewed with disdain (eg lobotomy, DDT); others seem incomplete or undeserved because they overlook workers who made key discoveries. By studying the work and careers of some laureates, students will become familiar with landmarks (and disasters) in twentieth-century science. They will also learn to write and criticize histories of science and commemoration. One half term graduate seminar; 3 hours/wk. Mechanism: core and secondary readings, student presentations, essays.\u00a0\u00a0 One-term seminar; winter.\u00a0",
