        "description": "Rapid Mechanical Design addresses all aspect of mechanical design, including consideration for end-of-life issues, with the focus and emphasis of the course being on rapid product development.\u00a0 In this course, the participants will be introduced to the various state-of-the-art methodologies and off-the-shelf tools and facilities for rapid design. The course will have an introductory section on a limited set of classical design topics in order to prepare the students for the in-depth discussion of the advanced topics on rapid prototyping. \u00a0 The introductory topics will include: Manufacturing Management Strategies, Concurrent Engineering, Conceptual Design, and Design for X. The advanced rapid-design topics are categorized into virtual and physical prototyping. Virtual prototyping topics include: Geometric Modeling (including major CAD software packages), Computer-Aided-Engineering (CAE) Analysis, Engineering Optimization, Design of Experiments, and Virtual Reality. Physical prototyping topics include: Introduction to Polymerization, Sintering, Casting, and Chemical Machining, Material-Additive Layered Prototyping (including Photolithography, Sintering, Deposition, Lamination, and Laser-Induced-Fusion Based Rapid-Prototyping Systems, Material-Removal-Based Prototyping, and Reverse Engineering.\u00a0 (Lead Instructors: Beno Benhabib, Toronto, Gene Zak, Queen's)\u00a0",
