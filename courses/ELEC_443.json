        "description": "Introduction to linear systems and feedback control. Analysis is done in both the time and frequency domains. Topics include time-domain specifications of second-order systems, PID control, steady-state error and disturbance rejection, root locus analysis, stability analysis using the Routh-Hurwitz criterion and the Nyquist criterion, and state-space analysis. These methods are applied and tested using software such as MATLAB/Simulink, and laboratory experiments.",
