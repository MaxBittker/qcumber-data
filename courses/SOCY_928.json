        "description": "This course considers various theoretical approaches to understanding the processes by which gender is socially constructed through law, and by which gender affects legal processes. Both public and private law will be analyzed, as will the role of the state in creating, maintaining and changing distinctions between public and private. While contemporary Canadian legal systems will be the central focus, historical and cross- national contexts will also be considered.",
