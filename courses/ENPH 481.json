The course presents an introduction to the electrical and optical properties of insulators, semiconductors and metals, including crystal structure, band theory, and electron transport. This is applied to obtain a physical understanding of the physics governing the behaviour of diodes, field effect and bipolar transistors, and other discrete optical and electronic devices.",
