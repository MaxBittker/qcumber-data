        "description": "This course provides an overall framework, with which students can begin to understand the elements, and the complex relationships among them, that lead to both entrepreneurial and innovation success.\u00a0 This course is the first in the program, and will serve to introduce specific topic areas that will be covered in greater depth throughout the remainder of the program.\u00a0 The course will be delivered in a concentrated and experiential fashion at the start of the program, so that students can experience the entire innovation context and use it as a first step in further discovering their specific area of focus within the program. Specific topics include: characteristics of successful entrepreneurs and innovators; business model, business case and business plan development; and structures for innovation.\u00a0 Students will apply each of these concepts during the course as they prepare their first new venture/innovation idea to be presented at the end of the course.\u00a0 In essence, this first course is a kickstart bootcamp to set up the rest of the program.\u00a0 Instructor: Elspeth Murray",
