Specifically, analytical methods and computational tools are developed to describe the microstructural evolution and stress response to deformation of single and polycrystalline metals. Specific topics include dislocation micro-mechanics and microstructural evolution, constitutive relations, large strain and texture evolution, failure and fracture, and temperature and rate effects. Three term-hours, lectures. B.J. Diak and A.K. Pilkey.",
