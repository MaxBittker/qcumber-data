        "description": "This seminar will explore the nature and value of the rule of law through a critical examination of the work of some contemporary legal philosophers.\u00a0 Among the problems we will consider are the following: What features in a legal system contribute to realizing the rule of law? What is \"legality\"? What is the relationship between the rule of law and the rule of good law? Is it always a virtue, other things being equal, to apply valid legal rules? How far is the rule of law consistent with the indeterminacy of law or with discretionary decision-making? Is the rule of law, as E.P. Thompson once suggested, an \"unqualified human good\"? Should the rule of law ever be sacrificed for sake of other goods?",
