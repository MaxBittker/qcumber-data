        "description": "This program focus supports candidates\u00bf scholarly and personal development as they prepare for professional practice in (a) international schools, and (b) other English speaking countries. This course is also appropriate for those considering international teaching after gaining full time teaching experience in Canada. Learning in this course occurs through a combination of structured classes, contact with professors, a self-directed independent study, and an alternative practicum. While an international alternative practicum placement is supported, it is not a requirement of this program focus. Candidates are <u>required</u> to link their alternative practicum to their Educators Abroad independent study. Regardless of career path, this course will help candidates address the complexities of teaching and learning in ESL, multicultural, and diverse contexts in Canada or abroad.",
