        "description": "A discussion of the processes that control energy, mass, and trace gas exchanges at the air-surface interface in the context of Earth System Science.\u00a0 Particular attention is given to soil and vegetation as modulators of energy and water exchange between the surface and the lower atmosphere. The controls of fluxes of trace gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, are reviewed and their role in global change discussed. Surface-atmosphere interaction modelling is introduced as an element of climate change analysis. Three term-hours",
