        "description": "Corporations are widely thought to have an economic obligation to enhance shareholder value and in doing so they have a wide range of legal obligations to stakeholders both within and outside of the organization. But are there moral obligations as well? If so, what are they and to who are they owed? This is a business ethics course taught from a philosophical perspective. No prior course work in ethics is presumed. It is intended for M.Sc. and Ph.D. students who want to deepen their knowledge of ethical issues in both the profit and not-for-profit sectors. For students pursuing further theoretical or empirical work in the field the course provides a solid theoretical foundation. Ethical theories to be examined include Utilitarianism, Kantian Deontology, human rights and virtue ethics. Building on these frameworks, ethical issues will be explored in areas that can include privacy, discrimination and affirmative action, whistle-blowing, workplace health and safety, advertising, conflict of interest, executive compensation, bribery in international business, corporate social responsibility and corporate governance.",
