        "description": "This course covers the kinematics and dynamics of rigid bodies in two and three dimensions, as well as an introduction to vibrations. Topics in dynamics include: mathematically rigorous kinematic analysis, Newton's laws, energy methods, impulse and momentum methods, mass moments of inertia, and gyroscopic motion. Topics in vibrations include: free and forced vibration of single-degree-of-freedom systems, undamped and damped systems, equivalent single degree of freedom system of continuous elements/systems using energy equivalence and equation of motion.",
