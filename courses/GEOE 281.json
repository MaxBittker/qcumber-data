        "description": "Introduction to all of the integrated fields of Geological Engineering and the essence of engineering design in an earth-systems context. Focus is on geological engineering properties and processes. Projects involve engineering design problems with a particular focus on dealing with scale dependency, sampling confidence, natural variability and risk-assessment related to the quantification of engineering properties for geomaterials. Introductory geotechnical engineering, applied geophysics, resource engineering and geo-environmental engineering is highlighted with emphasis on site investigation and design related to mining, tunnelling, infrastructure development, natural-hazard mitigation and environmental remediation and resource exploration and management.\u00a0A one day field trip is required.",
