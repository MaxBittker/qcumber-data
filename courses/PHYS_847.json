        "description": "Our understanding of the processes involved in planet formation have been revolutionized by astronomical discoveries of the Kuiper belt beyond Neptune in our Solar System and an increasingly large number of remarkably diverse planetary systems around other stars. This graduate module will summarize the observational constraints and review our theoretical understanding of the interplay of the physical processes leading to the formation of planets.",
