Soederberg. \r\nTopic: The Political Economy of Global Governance: NeoLiberalism, Power and Development \r\nDescription: Despite its popularity and centrality to contemporary economic, environmental, social and political life, global governance remains under-theorized. For example, we might ask: Who benefits from global governance? Whose values are being promoted, and why? Who is to be governed, and why? What roles have (neoliberal) states and markets played in the construction and reproduction of global governance? Which interests and \u00bfspaces\u00bf are excluded, and why? How are we to make sense of global governance in the larger, multi-disciplinary frame of global political economy? And, finally, how are we to understand the relevance of global governance with regard to North-South relations and wider questions of development? This course examines these questions analytically by exploring concrete and pertinent features of the global political economy, including the role played by states in facilitating the growing power of corporations, which in turn shape the wider development agenda.\r\nPrerequisite: MA standing in Global Development Studies, or permission of the Department.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \r\nExclusion: DEVS-496*",
