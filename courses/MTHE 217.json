Topics covered are: symbolic logic, switching and logic circuits; set theory and mappings; equivalence relations; the integers; introduction to Boolean algebras; group theory, groups, subgroups, cyclic groups, cosets and Lagrange's theorem, quotient groups, homomorphisms and isomorphisms; applications to error-control codes, binary block codes for noisy communication channels, nearest neighbor decoding, code error detection/correction capabilities, group (linear) codes, coset decoding, generator and parity check matrices, syndrome decoding; basic properties of rings and fields.",
