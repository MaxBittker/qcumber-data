        "description": "The first half of this course discusses the computation of aggregate variables and introduces students to dynamic models of long-run growth: the Solow model, the neoclassical growth model, overlapping generations models, and endogenous growth models.\u00a0 These are used to study long-run policy issues and the determinants of cross-country differences in per capita income and growth.\u00a0 The second half of the course introduces the student to real business cycle models and to the micro-foundations of models of nominal rigidities and non-market clearing.\u00a0 These are used to study the nature of short-run fluctuations and to evaluate macroeconomic policies related to stabilization, inflation, unemployment and the public debt.",
