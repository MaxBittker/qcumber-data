It is a senior seminar for third and fourth year students. Drawing on an interdisciplinary foundation of readings from business strategy, law, political science, and economics, students will be exposed to historical and contemporary thinking about the role of the corporation in society. In addition to this foundational material, students will investigate current and ongoing examples of corporate social responsibility activity from a variety of disciplinary perspectives, and will be expected to produce written and verbal reports on these cases, detailing the issues at stake and the reasoning behind their resolution.",
