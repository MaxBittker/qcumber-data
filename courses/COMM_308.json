The student should gain a deeper understanding of the roots of Canadian business, but more importantly, be able to understand and appreciate the complex internal and external forces which must be considered today when making critical business decisions. The course will be of interest to students who plan to follow a career in management as either a practitioner or a consultant and to those who will need to be able to do a comprehensive analysis and assessment of the financial and managerial performance of the modern firm.",
