        "description": "What are the objectives and what is the structure and content of the law governing judicial proof? As part of an allegedly rational system, how far are the rules consistent in principle and how do they work together? The course covers the common law of evidence, both civil and criminal, as it has been affected by legislation. Specifically, matters to be discussed include competence and compellability of witnesses, rules relating to the examination of witnesses, corroboration, burdens of proof and presumptions, judicial notice, illegally obtained evidence, privilege, hearsay, character, opinion, documentary and real evidence. Some attention will be devoted to the impact of new scientific knowledge and fact-finding techniques upon the system of judicial proof. (To be jointly with LAW-320.) Four term hours.",
