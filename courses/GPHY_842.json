        "description": "Methods and techniques for collecting, processing and analysing remote sensing data are examined. Special emphasis will be placed on airborne and satellite sensors operating in the visible and near-infrared regions of the spectrum, as well as airborne and spaceborne radar systems. Topics include image enhancement techniques, non-traditional image classification, hyperspectral data analysis and data integration for incorporation of remote sensing data products into Geographic Information Systems (GIS).
