        "description": "This course deals with subsurface contamination by hazardous industrial liquids such as PCB oils, gasoline, jet fuel, chlorinated solvents and coal tars. The fundamentals of multiphase/multicomponent flow and transport in soil and groundwater are outlined followed by specific treatment of both dense and light non-aqueous phase liquids. The course will examine the subsurface distribution of these liquids, site characterization methods, indoor air intrusion, regulatory apsects, remediation technologies, and selected case histories.",
