        "description": "Strategies for Social Enterprise is different from other business courses that emphasize specific aspects of management such as finance, marketing, accounting, information systems, or operations. Rather than focusing on a particular functional area, this course is designed to expose students to business strategies that have emerged to address important societal and environmental issues. The intent is to deepen your understanding of some of the ways in which issues such as poverty, climate change, health, habitat destruction, gender inequality, and pollution are being addressed by various types of organizations. We analyze several social enterprise business models that have evolved including market-driven firms that offer socially-conscious products, organizations that invest in less developed countries, businesses that focus on more than simply earning a profit, and institutions that are devoted to charitable work. This course is an approved course for students pursuing a Certificate in Socially Responsible Leadership.",
