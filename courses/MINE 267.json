Chemistry and chemical interactions for selected reagent formulations used in blasting, flotation/flocculation, leaching/precipitation, solvent extraction/electrowinning and pollution control technologies are outlined with relevant stoichiometry. Mineral stability and its relevance to metal extraction is discussed. Unary, binary and ternary phase diagrams are explored.\u00a0 The properties of solutions of interest are reviewed.",
