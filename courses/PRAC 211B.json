For example, candidates may choose to do a series of half days, or three full-time weeks, or a combination. Full-time weeks may be done during the fall or winter reading weeks, or at the end of the term in May, or a reasonable combination of any of these options.\u00a0 The placement must be completed in the same academic year.",
