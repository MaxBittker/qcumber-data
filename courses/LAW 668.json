        "description": "The international law of human rights constitutes one of the largest bodies of law within the broader realm of public international law. The aim of this course is to provide the student with a coherent framework for understanding that body of law along with the instruments for its application. In discussing the various facets of the international human rights regime, emphasis will be given to its conceptual foundations, its enforcement at the international, regional and domestic level, as well as practical implications and current challenges. Specific attention will be given to institutional features of the human rights regime, including at the regional level (Organisation of American States), the reception of international human rights law into the Canadian legal system, indigenous issues, the relationship between human rights and related areas, such as humanitarian law and international criminal law.",
