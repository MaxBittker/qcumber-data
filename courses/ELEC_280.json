        "description": "A study of the fundamental aspects of electromagnetic fields. The following topics are covered: partial differential equations for transmission lines and Maxwell\u00bfs equations; vector analysis, including orthogonal coordinate systems, and the calculus of field quantities; electrostatic fields including the concepts of electric potential, capacitance, and current and current density; magnetostatic fields including inductance; time\u00bfvarying fields and the complete form of Maxwell's equations; basic transmission line phenomena including steady\u00bfstate sinusoidal behaviour and standing waves, transient performance and impedance matching.",
