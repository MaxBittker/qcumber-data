        "description": "This course emphasizes the neuro-physiological organization of motor behaviour, sensory-motor integration, and the dynamic nature of the central nervous system. This course will provide a foundation for evaluating occupational performance from perception to action. It will focus on evaluation and intervention approaches for cognitive-perceptual and motor control problems at three levels: impairment, strategy and function. Attention will be given to secondary motor performance problems.",
