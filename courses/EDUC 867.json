Using cases and scenarios, students will examine ethical and moral conflicts and challenges to the legislation, governance, curriculum, as well as the overall aims and purposes, of schools. The focus will be on issues and concerns relevant to Canadian schools. This course is balanced between theory and practice, however, a significant component of the course includes student-led discussions and presentations of existing problems, ethical issues raised by these problems, and attempted solutions, both in theory and practice.
