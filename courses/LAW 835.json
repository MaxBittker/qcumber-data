        "description": "The controversiality of entrenching equality rights in the constitution has not diminished with the passage of almost two decades since the enactment of the Charter. Those who supported the constitutional guarantee of equality rights usually adverted to the need for a more inclusive notion of human dignity. The critics contended that, as a second generation right, equality would be divisive because it would enable litigants to challenge traditionally accepted values such as the freedoms of association, expression and contract, as well as liberty, privacy and property. It may still be too soon to know who is right but it is timely to examine equality rights jurisprudence to determine: the meaning of the right to equality; whether that meaning varies and, if so, under what conditions; the limits of the right to equality; the controversies about the right to equality that the courts have resolved, and those that remain unresolved; and the perspectives that the various historically disadvantaged groups might reasonably be expected to take about the value of entrenching equality rights in the constitution given judicial reasoning and decision-making to date.\u00a0\u00a0 (To be jointly with LAW-535.)
