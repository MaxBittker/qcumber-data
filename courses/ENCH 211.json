The stereochemistry and chirality of organic compounds, solid-state inorganic chemistry, and descriptive chemistry of compounds of the main group elements will be covered. The laboratory will introduce skills in inorganic and organic synthesis. \r\nNOTE: Laboratory consumables: estimated cost $20.",
