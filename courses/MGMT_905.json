        "description": "This seminar introduces you to theoretical and empirical literature in the domain of entrepreneurship. Research in entrepreneurship draws on a range of other disciplines. In this course the core discipline most frequently drawn upon in the assigned readings will be sociology (and its sub-domains of economic sociology and institutional theory) followed by economics. Theories drawn from psychology will be much less prominent. Following an introduction to entrepreneurship as a distinct field of research, each week will focus on a different stage of the entrepreneurial life cycle of a firm. Topics may include opportunity recognition, the process of innovation, institutional influences on entrepreneurship, the role that networks and social capital play in the development and growth of firms, corporate entrepreneurship, and entrepreneurial exit.",
