        "description": "International humanitarian law (IHL) is a set of rules which seek, for humanitarian reasons, to limit the effects of armed conflict. It protects persons who are not or are no longer participating in the hostilities and restricts the means and methods of warfare that belligerents may use.\u00a0 International humanitarian law is also known as the law of war or the law of armed conflict.\u00a0 IHL is related to other fields of public international law, in particular to International Criminal Law and to International Human Rights Law. Because IHL purports to regulate the conduct of hostilities, it must, in order to remain relevant, be inherently flexible and fluid in its development.\u00a0 This seminar course explores the evolution and operation of IHL from its ancient roots through to contemporary armed conflicts.\u00a0 The primary focus of this course will be to understand how and why IHL has evolved;\u00a0 use that understanding to analyze how it addresses the challenges posed by the complex nature of contemporary armed conflict; and assess how new legal approaches might be used to provide enhanced protection to victims of armed conflict.",
