Among the larger issues that configure social relations are: racism, sexism, homophobia, able-ism, classism, ethnocentrism, ageism and intellectualism. Additional issues for examination include the impact of students' cultural context on their school experiences, the impact of the school culture, including teachers' attitudes and expectations, and impact of the hidden curriculum.",
