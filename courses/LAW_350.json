        "description": "Students in this course are given a carefully selected actual case which has received Leave to Appeal from the Supreme Court of Canada.\u00a0 Along with instruction and practice presentations during the term, students will be formed into groups of Appellants and Respondents to prepare and argue this case.\u00a0 Factums are drafted, filed and served amongst the opposing student teams.\u00a0 At the end of the term the case is argued by the student teams at the Frontenac County Court House.\u00a0 Case selection is made with timing in mind so that the actual case will then be argued before the Supreme Court of Canada sometime shortly after the end of the course.\r\nThis course examines oral advocacy skills and the preparation of facta. Students work in teams and will normally be required to participate in oral presentation exercises, conduct a moot, and draft facta for court matters under appeal. \r\nNote: there is some variation in the specific matters dealt with amongst the sections of this course; individual descriptions for each section are posted at http://law.queensu.ca/students/jdprogram/2011-2012UpperYearProgram/",
