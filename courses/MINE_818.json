        "description": "Theories and application of rock mechanics principles in underground and open pit mine design are discussed. General areas of concentration include assessment of elastic for rock; the determination and influence of in-situ stress on excavation stability; evaluation of ground movement, subsidence and convergence; review of rock slope stability factors and mitigation techniques for stabilization; and assessment of contemporary and innovative measures for ground support provision in underground mines.",
