        "description": "This course will study the legal doctrine that governs the sentencing and imprisonment phases of the criminal justice system. We will look primarily at three aspects of \"Sentencing and Imprisonment\": (1) The Philosophical Principles of Sentencing; (2) The Law of Sentencing; and (3) Judicial Remedies for Convicted Persons: Constitutional and Administrative. We will pay special attention to the situation of Aboriginal people in the criminal justice system and to recent shifts in the politicization of crime policy. We will think comparatively and critically about the Canadian prison system and will consider strategic litigation possibilities throughout the course. The course will follow a lecture/discussion format and the (2008) Second Edition of \"Sentencing and Penal Policy in Canada\" will be used.",
