        "description": "The equivalent of three full weeks in an elementary (K-8) setting (minimum 90 hours) including contact with a special needs student. Candidates observe three students and prepare a sample simplified Individual Education Plan on one of the observed students, as well as plan and teach three lessons in a traditional classroom setting, or complete the equivalent planning and implementation in an alternative setting such as a school library or resource room.\u00a0 The format is to be very flexible but pre-planned. For example, candidates may choose to do a series of half days, or three full-time weeks, or a combination. Full-time weeks may be done during the fall or winter reading weeks, or at the end of the term in May, or a reasonable combination of any of these options.\u00a0 The placement must be completed in the same academic year.",
