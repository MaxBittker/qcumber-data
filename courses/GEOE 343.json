Field instrumentation, installation and sampling protocols, elements of groundwater investigation. Assessment of measurement techniques and interpretation of fundamental hydrogeological properties. Groundwater occurrence, flow system analysis, with a focus on designing extraction schemes. During the required field activities, students investigate a groundwater problem by taking measurements to be reduced and interpreted in report form. Given jointly with GEOL 833.",
