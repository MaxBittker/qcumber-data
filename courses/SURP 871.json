The quality of life in cities and regions as influenced by land use policies, community design as well as service strategies will be analyzed. Public policies and programs will be examined in the perspective of meeting needs of divergent populations identified by attributes such as class, race, gender and culture. Public, private and community-based modes of service delivery will be reviewed both in Canadian and comparative perspectives. Specific topics in the course will vary from year to year.\u00a0",
