        "description": "Roles and applications of flotation in the mining industry, tailings management, recycling and environmental clean-up are discussed. The topics include both interfacial aspects such as wettability, electrical double layer theories, dispersioncoagulation/flocculation, reagent interactions, as well as the engineering aspects such as sampling/mass balancing, kinetics and circuit design. Primary examples of technologies related to processing of sulphide ores, non-sulphides, salts, coals and tar sands are covered. The course includes laboratory sessions on selected topics.",
