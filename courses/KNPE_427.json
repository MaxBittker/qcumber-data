        "description": "The focus is on aspects of skeletal muscle energy metabolism related to exercise and nutrition, with a particular emphasis on the regulation of carbohydrate and fat metabolism and the mechanisms regulating their use as substrates for muscle during rest and exercise. The use of nutrition and exercise in humans to assess the impact of these perturbations on whole body metabolism are considered.\nNOTE\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This course will normally be offered in academic years starting with an even number (e.g., 2012-2013).
