The Roman army constitutes one of the most documented groups from the ancient world. Forts, inscriptions, and military paraphernalia have been found in all parts of the former Roman Empire. A rich collection of ancient literary texts relating to Roman military practices has also survived. By studying this material, students will learn not just about the Roman army, but about the range of materials available for studying the ancient world in general. B. Reeves. Fall or Winter Term.",
