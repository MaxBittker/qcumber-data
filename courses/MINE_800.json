        "description": "The purpose of the course is to develop the knowledge required to design mining systems and processes for efficient separation of the minerals of interest from the waste. The course builds on undergraduate knowledge and provides an in-depth study of the techniques utilized in the field. The emphasis is on current theory and design methods as well as on modern trends and evolving technologies. The course is given in modules by a number of faculty and spans mining to mineral processing. Topics to be covered include: mining methods, rock breakage, ground stability, ventilation, materials handling, mineral beneficiation and economic and environmental assessments.",
