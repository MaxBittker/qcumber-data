        "description": "This course engages teacher candidates in designing ways of using educational technology that address authentic teaching and learning problems. Emphasis is on the creative repurposing of educational technology to respond to substantive teaching and learning problems derived from sources in the field. Issues associated with using educational technology will be addressed through face-to-face seminars, workshops and group design projects. The goal of this course will be for candidates to develop a deep appreciation for the complexity of designing viable solutions to educational problems that utilize educational technology. Prototyped designs will be piloted in practice-based settings and final reports will be shared with educators via webpages and during an end of year Educational Technology Showcase that will be open to local teachers.",
