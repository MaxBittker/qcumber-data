        "description": "Law and Economics has become a highly influential lens through which law is conceptualized and analyzed. Economic analysis provide one means of \tcritically examining the way that law functions and thinking about how we might want to design laws to better achieve the social objectives that underpin them. This course will involve both \tstudy and critique of the\u00a0 law and economics approach. The course will introduce students to the central tools and concepts of law and economics. We will begin with a brief introduction to some basic economic theory and move on to study the application of law and economics analysis to particular problems in a variety of substantive legal domains. Applications in the area of property, tort, criminal, environmental law, equality rights, and operation of the legal system, among other substantive domains, will be considered.\u00a0 (To be offered jointly with LAW-328.)\u00a0 Three term hours.",
