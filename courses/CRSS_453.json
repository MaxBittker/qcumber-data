Topics include mechanics and regulation of heart function as well as perturbations in cardiac function. Oxygen delivery and utilization will be examined at the levels of the lung, blood, and tissue. The responses to alterations in oxygen demand and/or supply will also be addressed. Obstructive sleep apnea will be used as a model of a pathological cardiorespiratory system interactions.\nNOTE\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Priority given to students in the CRSS Sub-Plan.",
