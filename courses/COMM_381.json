        "description": "Since legal considerations enter into nearly all business transactions and influence most important managerial decisions, owners and managers of business firms make their economic choices and take actions within the general framework of law and jurisprudence. While government and business exert a powerful influence on each other, the judge\u00bfmade common law of contract is the basic law governing not only business activities but dealings between persons in society. This course will explore the Canadian legal infrastructure and context, and the laws of tort and contract \u00bf the two most important private law doctrines. Students will not only learn a cursory understanding of the law, but also a framework for solving legal problems as business people or professionals. This course is one of the Canadian Institute for Chartered Accountants Education Requirements.",
