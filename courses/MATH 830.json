        "description": "This course covers core topics in discrete and continuous time modern control theory: controllability, observability and minimal realizations; Lyapunov stability; the linear quadradic regulator and design of robust controllers; state estimation via Luenberger and deterministic Kalman-Bucy filters. Laboratory experiments illustrate design considerations in implementing the lecture material. Students are required to identify a high order under-actuated torsion disc system; perform model verification experiments; design and implement robust linear feedback controllers; design and implement nonlinear sliding mode controllers; study implementation issues for observers and Kalman-Bucy filters; depending on instructor, some nonlinear control strategies may be implemented.\u00a0\u00a0(Offered jointly with MATH-430*.) Three term hours, fall; lectures.",
