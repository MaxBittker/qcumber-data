        "description": "(Technological Education Internship candidates only). Introduction to concepts, practices and processes in the curriculum field. The ability to teach effectively depends to a large extent on a teacher's ability to act as a curriculum planner for both long and short term planning. In order for teacher candidates to become curriculum planners in broad-based technology, readings, discussions, and activities are used to combine both research and teacher candidates' experience. Teacher candidates use this knowledge and their school experiences to articulate curriculum that will guide their practice as curriculum planners. Candidates complete projects and project reports for Grade 9, discuss possible curricular approaches for Grade 10, and develop an assessment package.",
