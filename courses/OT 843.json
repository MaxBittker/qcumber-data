        "description": "This course will introduce students to the study of movement of the human body as it relates to occupation. It will have an emphasis on biomechanics and the components of the motor system as determinants of motor performance in occupation. Evaluation methods and modalities used in physical rehabilitation will be studied. The course will also focus on the application of physical rehabilitation methods used in occupational therapy practice by understanding musculo-skeletal conditions and occupational therapy interventions at the level of impairment and activity limitations.",
