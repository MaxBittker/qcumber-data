Musculoskeletal structures of the upper limb, lower limb, head, cervical, thoracic, lumbar and pelvic regions will be reviewed, including details of how muscles and joints function. Neural, cardiovascular, and pulmonary structures will be reviewed, focusing on structures in which pathology leads or contributes to movement dysfunction. Lab Component.",
