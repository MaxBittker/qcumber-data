Roberts.\r\nTopic: Gender and the Global Politcal Economy: Financial Crises and Beyond\r\nDescription: Mainstream approaches to analyzing finance and the global political economy tend to be based on rational choice theorizing and view markets as objective and gender 'neutral structures. The purpose of this course is to explore feminist approaches to finance and the global political economy in order to reveal the gendered assumptions that underpin global markets and which perpetuate various inequalities, including those based along the lines of gender and race. The course will provide an overview of mainstream, critical and feminist approaches to interpreting the global political economy, including past and present financial crises in the Global North and the Global South that have been persistent features of capitalism.\r\nPrerequisite: MA standing in Global Development Studies, or permission of the Department.\r\nExclusion: DEVS-493*",
