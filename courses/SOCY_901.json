Key sociological concepts are studied in a variety of contexts spanning from the micro to macro levels of social action.\u00a0 Although heavily reliant on the main historical developments in sociology (Marx, Weber and Durkheim), emphasis is place on post Second World War II developments in sociological theory.",
