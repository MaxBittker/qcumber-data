        "description": "This laboratory introduces the use of motion control devices such as optical encoders, pulse width amplifiers and armature controlled DC servo motors. The experiments complement the analytical and theoretical work on control taken in other third year courses. Students design and implement proportional, proportional-derivative, and proportional-integral-derivative controllers.",
