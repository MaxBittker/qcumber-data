        "description": "Policies and practices associated with grading and evaluation play a very important but highly controversial and problematic role in today's schools. Candidates are encouraged to examine and critically assess a variety of contemporary policies and practices as well as proposals for reform, including the purposes and functions of grading and evaluation, the nature and role of standards, subjectivity in evaluation, alternative systems of assessment, portfolio assessments, and other approaches to documenting student accomplishment, as well as report cards and parent teacher conferences. Insights from the literature and candidates' practicum experiences are applied to problems facing classroom teachers. Candidates are encouraged to develop applications relevant to their own concerns with teaching and learning.",
