        "description": "This course is designed to provide fundamental understanding of the relationship between the crystallographic and microstructural properties of functional ceramics and their properties and application. The emphasis is placed on the mechanisms of conduction in ionic solids, semiconductors and superconductors along with the structure, properties and application of ferroelectric, magnetic and optical materials. The breadth and importance of this class of ceramics in modern electronic industries is reviewed. This course is offered in conjunction with MECH-474, but has additional reading and work assignments.
