        "description": "This course examines Canada's financial system and the principal economic forces which shape both the system itself and the kinds of financial deals it can bring about. The course studies financial institutions and financial markets in Canada and in other major countries. It examines the decision processes of both the suppliers and the users of funds, using models of the financial intermediary process to examine several kinds of financing decisions. Internationally, Canada can only compete successfully for financial business if its performance standards measure up to those of other countries. Similarly on the domestic front, Canadians can sometimes learn to innovate with greater success by examining practices in other countries. Thus, the course studies many examples of international finance as practised in the Euromarkets, and of domestic practice in such countries as Great Britain, the United States, and Japan. The importance of economic and regulatory policy on financial markets and institutions is emphasized throughout.",
