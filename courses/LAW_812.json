        "description": "This is an introductory survey course, in which we will discuss the general foundations of international law. Accordingly, we will discuss the sources of international law and the relevant actors (such as States and \"peoples\") and forums (such as the United Nations and the International Court of Justice). We will also examine selected topics such as state responsibility, extraterritorial jurisdiction, immunities, the use of force, the responsibility to protect and human rights. The course focuses not only on the relevant rules but on how to analyze problems and construct successful legal arguments using international legal tools, in a milieu where power, politics and principles are in constant interplay. (To be offered jointly with LAW-540.) Three term hours.",
