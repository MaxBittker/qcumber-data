M.Sc./M.Sc.(Eng.) students\u00a0 are required to take MECH-897 and Ph.D. students are required to take MECH-997. The content of the seminar is to be developed in cooperation with the student's supervisor. The seminar will be evaluated by assigned faculty and a pass/referred decision will be recorded. The student must obtain a pass grade to clear this course requirement. The evaluation process for the seminar is defined in the departmental procedures. This course carries no course credit but is a degree requirement in the Department of Mechanical and Materials Engineering.",
