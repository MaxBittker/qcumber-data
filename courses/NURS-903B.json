        "description": "This course prepares nurse scientists to advance nursing knowledge through independent research using quantitative methods. It focuses on measurement, design, analytic techniques, reliability of measures, and commonly used statistical methods. Qualitative-quantitative triangulation will also be examined. Emphasis will be placed on the appropriateness of design for the level of theoretical knowledge available and the nature of the research problem to be investigated, the research question, and hypotheses. Emphasis will also be placed on the links between research design and statistical analyses. Statistical methods to be covered will include multiple regression, analysis of variance and covariance, and logistic regression. Fall and Winter terms.",
