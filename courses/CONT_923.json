        "description": "In Kindergarten Parts 1 and 2, the primary focus was on building a solid foundation for your classroom practice. The Kindergarten Specialist course extends the knowledge and skills of prior courses continuing to focus on theory and practice in the education of students in the early years. In addition, participants will have the opportunity to develop an understanding of school and board level leadership through the exploration of current issues in developmentally appropriate practice, Kindergarten programming and their implications for classroom, school and board level curriculum. This course prepares you to take on a broader role within your school and board. It will prepare you to mentor new teachers, support experienced teachers, and work with Kindergarten teams as they design, plan, and implement effective programming for Kindergarten students.",
