        "description": "This case, project, and readings course takes a best practices approach. We identify, study, and learn from the retailers who compete successfully in the global marketplace. These retailers will be compared in the way they manage consumer demand, the multi-national work force and supply chain assets. As the term progresses, the focus of the course will shift from a strategic and global perspective to the day-to-day management of the retail business. Topics include retail market strategy, market choice and entry mode, location, retail store patronage behaviour, financial / productivity analyses, sourcing, logistics and information systems, electronic retailing, merchandise management, and merchandise pricing. This course is for those who are interested in either starting their own retail business or managing existing small and large retail businesses. It is also relevant to those who would serve the retail sector, e.g., brand management, sales, manufacturers/suppliers, and financial analysts.",
