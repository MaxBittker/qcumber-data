Laboratory exercises will be used to illustrate key issues related to signal acquisition and processing. Seminar presentations will allow students to investigate and present the application of data acquisition and processing specific to their particular area of interest.\u00a0 Three term hours, winter. Limited enrollment.\u00a0EXCLUSION: KHS-851*, KHS-857*, RHBS-857*/957*, RHBS-835*/935*\u00a0",
