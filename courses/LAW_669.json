These Tribunals prosecute persons who allegedly committed such crimes during wars in the Former Yugoslavia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Cambodia and Indonesia.\u00a0 The focus will be on the development of the law applicable to individual criminal responsibility, international crimes, principles applicable in armed conflict, and command responsibility. The primary source will be the law and practice of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, but also that of the Rwanda Tribunal, Sierra Leone Tribunal and the International Criminal Court.",
