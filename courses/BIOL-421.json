        "description": "This course will explore genetic aspects of conservation, addressing questions such as: How is genetic variation lost? Can loss of genetic variation result in extinction? How much genetic variation is 'enough' for population viability? Can loss of genetic variation be prevented? How do we define management units for conservation? And is hybridization a problem or a benefit for conservation?",
