        "description": "Considers mechanical vibration, the problems it presents and the means of dealing with it. Completes the treatment of systems with two degrees-of-freedom (introduced in \u00a0MECH 328) and proceeds to systems with higher number of degrees-of-freedom. Co-ordinate systems, types of coupling, matrix formulation, vibration absorbers and dampers, specific and hysteretic damping, Rayleigh's method, torsional vibration, Holzer method, introduction to the finite element method, beam vibration.",
