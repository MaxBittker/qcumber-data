        "description": "This module studies astrophysical situations in which Newtonian dynamics fails at the local scale. Topics include:\u00a0 Neutron Stars: Origin, current understanding of their structure, interaction with their environment and the importance of binary pulsars in verifying the status of general relativity.\u00a0 Black Holes: Origin, current understanding of their uniqueness properties in the static and stationary cases, interaction with their environment and the importance of black holes in a cosmological context.",
