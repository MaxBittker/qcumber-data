        "description": "This course is intended for students at both the Masters and Doctoral levels who already have a good background in fundamental topics related to their research or course-based programs of study, and who are interested in broadening their exposure to other subject areas of mining engineering that are not offered through existing graduate courses. Topics will focus on either mining, mineral processing or mine-mechanical-related areas of mining engineering, and will be presented through lectures, seminar presentations, open classroom discussion and self-directed independent study. The specific course content to be taught to students will be posted in writing at the beginning of each term in which this course will be given, and cannot be related in topic content to a student\u00bfs research thesis or project topic. Marking for the course will be assessed on the basis of student assignments, written reports and classroom presentations.",
