Topics to be covered will include understanding one's own negotiation style, analyzing problems, defining and uncovering interests, developing options, brainstorming, joint problem-solving, using fair standards, dealing with \"hard bargainers\" and understanding the norms and ethics which are part of the negotiating process. Negotiation role-plays will be taken from all areas from the simple to the more complex.\u00a0 (To be offered jointly with LAW-335.) Three term-hours; Winter. L. Crush.",
