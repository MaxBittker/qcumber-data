Theoretical and pedagogical questions will be raised throughout the course, and students will be required to teach a one-hour enrichment class, once a week for 10 weeks, to grade 7 or 8 students in a local elementary school.\r\nNOTE\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Students may incur transportation costs. These will vary, but are expected to be no more than $50. Students must obtain a criminal record check at their local police prior to the course. A fee will be charged.\u00a0\r\nNOTE\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Does not prepare student for courses in mathematics or statistics. This course may not be included in a MATH or STAT plan.",
