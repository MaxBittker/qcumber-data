        "description": "A study of the Hispanic oral narrative tradition with special focus on the Mexican corrido. Students examine audio, cinematographic, documentary, and written productions in order to explore the role oral narrative plays in the development of identities in local, regional, national, and international contexts. Readings will cover attempts to define oral narrative from sociological, archetypical, historical, and structural perspectives. Students will be asked to consider how the inclusion of an oral narrative tradition comes to bear on configurations of literary history and theory.\u00a0",
