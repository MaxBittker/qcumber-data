        "description": "Aspects of the bed and bank deformation of alluvial rivers will be addressed. Topics covered include hydraulics of flow in river channels; mechanics and quantification of sediment transport; sediment transport continuity equation; bed forms and flow resistance; regime concept and determination of equilibrium (stable) alluvial channels; adjustments of equilibrium and river channel changes; geometry and mechanics of meandering and braiding streams; local scour and related problems. Computer-aided study of alluvial river processes will be discussed. Three term-hours.",
