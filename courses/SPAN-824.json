        "description": "The interlude holds an important place in the history of Spanish Golden Age theatre. First performed on the streets, this short play genre eventually became an integrative part of main stage productions and royal performances. Embracing a carnavalesque topsy-turvy view of the world, it questions and subverts the norms of society. This course will cover the literary, social and historical ramifications of this theatre genre and highlight their relevance to our contemporary world. 0.5 credits. Three term-hours. To be offered in alternate years.",
