        "description": "This course examines corporate strategy dynamics, studying how firms scan the environment, gather information, and deal with information asymmetries; how firms perceive, interpret, and respond to environmental threats; and how firms transact under conditions of market failure. These dynamics will be studied in the context of organizational growth, acquisitions, reconfiguration, spatial evolution, strategic alliances, and divestiture. The course is expected to provide opportunities for students to develop and present research ideas in an emerging field. In addition, the course aims to contribute to student research efforts by (i) examining an emerging synthesis of existing theories that has application across domains, including innovation, CSR, governance, strategy process, international business, emerging market strategy, and institutional theory, and (ii) exploring the research process in complex empirical contexts.",
