        "description": "The purpose of this course is to examine the use of the creative aspects of mathematics to study ways in which mathematics can be integrated into art, music, biology, architecture, literature, history, agriculture, technology, and engineering. Educational research tells us that students learn best and make better sense of what they're learning when they can make connections with previous learning or with different areas of learning. Integrated curricula are intended to help students make connections across fields and deepen both their understanding and skills and appreciation for mathematics. Teacher candidates will assess practical examples of integration in formal and informal curriculum settings, informed by research about integrative mathematics pathways and their impact on teaching and achievement.",
