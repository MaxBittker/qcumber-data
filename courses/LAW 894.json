        "description": "Contracts and the law that governs them are fundamental to economic life in our society, and there is scarcely an area of legal practice in which issues of contract law do not figure. Advanced Contract Law builds on foundations laid in the introductory study of contract law, broadening and deepening the student\u00bfs knowledge of this richly-textured subject. The course will cover a selection of advanced issues in contract law. Examples of topics that may be covered in any given year include: illegality; agency; assignment; contractual construction; good faith; implied terms; paternalism and the problem of standard forms; unconscionability; economic duress; the interaction of contract with tort and restitution; the estoppels(equitable; conventional; in pais; proprietary). The course will be structured around readings drawn primarily from cases decided by common law courts here and abroad, and also from the scholarly literature. (To be offered jointly with LAW-458.) Not offered 2010-2011.",
