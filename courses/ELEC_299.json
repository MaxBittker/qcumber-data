        "description": "A team design project based around an autonomous, programmable, robotic vehicle, following on from project activity in APSC 200. Students explore different sensors and software strategies for vehicle control and navigation, in addition to wiring up sensor and motor circuits. The design goal is to configure and program a vehicle to take part in a year-end competition in which robots compete head-to-head on a pre-defined playfield under established competition rules. A final project report must be produced that documents the experimentation, design, and testing. A final exam tests knowledge of sensors and software. (0/0/0/0/18)",
