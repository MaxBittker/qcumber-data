Specific areas to be covered include introduction to new drug development, molecular basis of oncogenic transformation and signalling pathways, challenges with current cancer therapeutics, molecular approaches to profiling human cancers as tools for identifying biochemical and genetic abnormalities and developing criteria for reliable prognostic indicators; strategies for novel target and drug discovery, as well as experimental drug delivery; novel imaging approaches to enhance the sensitivity of preclinical testing and selection of responsive patients; preclinical (in vitro and animal) models for validating experimental targets; clinical drug development and testing of novel anti-cancer drugs; and the molecular basis for variability in tumour responses. Half course, lectures and seminars; fall term. C. Nicol",
