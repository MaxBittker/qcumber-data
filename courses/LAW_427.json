        "description": "FALL SESSION: This course will provide an introductory overview of administrative\u00a0law - which principally concerns the legal regulation and judicial\u00a0supervision of the executive branch of government. The course will\u00a0examine issues such as the content of procedural fairness,\u00a0substantive compliance with statutory mandates, and the dilemmas\u00a0associated with the judicial review of discretionary decision making, all in the context of a broad range of substantive areas of law \u00adincluding labour relations, municipal planning and zoning,\u00a0constitutional, environmental, immigration, banking, and securities\u00a0law, among others. The appropriate relationship between courts and\u00a0administrative tribunals and officers is an overarching concern.\u00a0 Students will develop an understanding of the executive and\u00a0administrative processes of government and will appreciate some of\u00a0the design or structural problems in creating a system of public\u00a0interest decision-making which is efficient and effective while\u00a0 recognizing valued individual interests and rights.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 WINTER SESSION:\u00a0\u00a0 The primary focus of the course will be on the relationship between the courts and the executive and administrative branches of government; and on the role of judicial review of administrative action in the Canadian constitutional and governmental framework. In this context, the course will examine in detail the major bases for judicial review of administrative action - ultra vires action, jurisdictional error, abuse of discretion, error of law and procedural unfairness. As well, the various remedies, both common law and statutory, for unlawful administrative action will be considered. It is also the intention that, from the cases and other materials studied, the student will develop a better understanding of the executive and administrative processes and will appreciate some of the design or structural problems in creating a system of public interest decision-making which is efficient and effective and which recognizes and gives scope for valued individual interests and concerns.",
