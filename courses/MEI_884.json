        "description": "Design thinking is an important element of building effective business models for new entrepreneurial and intrapreneurial ventures. At the same time, design thinking lies at the heart of engineering, within the context of an understanding of the physical world around us. A convergence is emerging between the\u00a0 design\u00a0 approach\u00a0\u00a0 in\u00a0 engineering,\u00a0\u00a0 and\u00a0 the\u00a0 design\u00a0 approach\u00a0\u00a0 in\u00a0 business\u00a0\u00a0 that\u00a0 draws\u00a0 from\u00a0 an understanding of customers, markets and finance. This course is designed to provide to provide a foundation\u00a0 for\u00a0 design\u00a0 thinking\u00a0 in\u00a0 both\u00a0 contexts,\u00a0 along\u00a0 with\u00a0 insights,\u00a0 skills\u00a0 and\u00a0 tools\u00a0 to\u00a0 deploy\u00a0 this important mindset effectively.\u00a0 Instructors: Tim Bryant, James McLellan, Kim Woodhouse",
