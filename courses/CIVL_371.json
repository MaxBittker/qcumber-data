        "description": "This course introduces students to the fundamentals of groundwater systems with an emphasis on the engineering design of extraction systems for water supply, site dewatering, and parameter estimation tests. Source water protection methods will be discussed. Equations governing the flow of groundwater, flownets, and capture zones are presented. Detailed case histories are presented. Laboratories make extensive use of commercial grade software for surface and groundwater flow simulationPPE will be required for this course at student's cost (see course materials for details).",
