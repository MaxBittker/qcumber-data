        "description": "The course prompts an examination of fundamental issues in insurance law in a prescriptive way, relevant to today's lawyers. Insurance law is really a melding of contract principles with tort claims and so necessarily draws on the analytical foundation from both major areas of law. Really, insurance law is often about seeking compensation for a person in the wrong place at the wrong time. This course will focus on insurance arising from motor vehicle accidents. We will address the SABS (Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule), definition of Catastrophic Impairment, collateral benefits, available of various heads of damages, and the threshold. This course aims to provide a working knowledge of the terminology and doctrine in a variety of insurance law spheres: automobile, liability, property, life, health and disability insurance. However, particular emphasis is placed on auto insurance. (To be offered jointly with LAW-443.) Three term hours.",
