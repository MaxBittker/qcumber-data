        "description": "This course examines the basic components of compensation systems (i.e., compensation objectives, job hierarchies, forms of pay, salary survey, etc.). A Canadian text is used that combines economic, sociological and psychological approaches to the study and design of pay systems. The course uses a detailed description of a hypothetical organization and a problem-oriented teaching method to explore topics such as the relationship between compensation systems and firm performance, and the tradeoffs between internal and external equity in the design of compensation systems.",
