Not offered 2011-2012. \r\nTopic: Education\r\nDescription: Following international conferences in the 1990s, development, research, and governance institutions joined in the call for 'Education for All' characterized by a massive institutional push to increase primary school enrolment in the developing world. This course takes a critical and theoretical look at one of the most powerful and enduring ideas of development ' that education is the first step to progress and freedom from poverty. A range of theorists such as Antonio Gramsci, Michel Foucault, Paulo Freire, bell hooks, and Amartya Sen help explore whether schooling is an inevitable good, a tool for hegemonic domination, or a contradictory resource.\r\nPrerequisite: MA standing in Global Development Studies, or permission of the Department.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \r\nExclusion: DEVS-497*",
