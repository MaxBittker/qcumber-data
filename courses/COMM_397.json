These systems are now at the forefront of information technologies as modern businesses evolve into flexible, knowledge-based organizations. Students will study how these systems are developed. Students will examine the various roles that hardware, software, and people play in the effective use of these systems. Students will design and build a small knowledge-based system using a software package such as Lotus Notes or GroupSystems V.",
