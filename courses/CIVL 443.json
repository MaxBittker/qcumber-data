        "description": "A design-based course where geotechnical and hydrogeologic principles are applied to study environmentally sustainable disposal of solid waste. Topics studied include: source and nature of waste: disposal options; environmental legislation and regulations; public impact and perception; contaminant transport; use of geosynthetic materials; and design issues and tradeoffs. Students will conduct practical design tasks to investigate the planning, design, construction, operation and post-closure of phases of an engineered waste disposal facility. The important role of geology in geoenvironmental problems is emphasized through classroom discussions, planning a site investigation and constructing a geologic model.",
