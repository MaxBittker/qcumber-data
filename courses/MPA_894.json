        "description": "This field course provides students with an opportunity to apply their knowledge, enhance their professional skills and gain practical experience by combining formal studies with a cooperative or internship work placement. Students selected by host employers are placed with a government agency normally for a minimum 10 week period in approved positions. To consolidate their learning from this practical experience, participating students are required to submit a final report, in accordance with specific guidelines, which will be graded on a pass/fail basis, by a faculty member. Work-study placements may be paid or unpaid. This is a 3.0 credit unit course, is graded on a pass/fail basis and does not count towards the requirements of the degree.",
