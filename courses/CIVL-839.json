        "description": "This course will present a number of advanced approximate methods for analyzing structures. Topics covered\u00a0 include: analysis of statically indeterminate trusses and frames; model analysis; energy principles; numerical integration for solving structural problems including Newmark\u00bfs method and beams on elastic foundations;\u00a0 structural vibrations including Rayleigh\u00bfs principle, Stodola\u00bfs iteration technique, and distributed mass systems using Newmark\u00bfs method; structural stability including the energy criterion for stability, lower-bound methods, the method of\u00a0 Vianello, columns with lateral\u00a0 loads, Perry\u00bfs approximation, the conjugate beam method, stability of unbraced frames and multi-storey building frames; plastic collapse of plane frames,\u00a0 including the plastic moment of a cross-section, and limit theorems of plastic collapse; limit analysis of plates and slabs including the upper and lower bound methods, failure mechanisms, combined loading, and the strip method for slab design.
