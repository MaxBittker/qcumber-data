Based on the project objective provided by their faculty supervisor, the students will work independently to develop an experimental and/or modeling methodology, conduct experiments or simulations and generate data. Students will submit interim oral and written progress reports and a final oral presentation and technical report. They will be expected to present and defend their results in a conference/seminar setting.
