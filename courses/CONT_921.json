        "description": "In the Kindergarten years, the focus is on the instruction of the whole child. Teachers must provide learning opportunities that will help students develop emotionally, socially and academically. This is a time of incredible growth. Teachers who provide meaningful and engaging instruction will help students gain valuable knowledge - both academic and about functioning in the social environment of a school.\r\nThis course will build on what you already know about students in the early years and the instructional strategies that are appropriate for this age group. Further, it will ask you to think deeply about developmentally appropriate practice, curriculum, and classroom management.",
