        "description": "An introductory course concerning the basic principles governing the formation, operation and dissolution of the family in Canada. Specific topics to be considered are validity and annulment of marriage, rights and obligations of persons who\u00a0 cohabit outside marriage, gay and lesbian relationships, domestic contracts, domestic violence, support, custody and access to children, the law of divorce and ownership, possession and division of matrimonial property. Most attention will be paid to the law applicable in Ontario, but where appropriate, references and comparisons may be made to developments in other provinces and countries. There is substantial similarity in the family law of Canada's common law jurisdictions. The primary focus of the course will be upon substantive legal principles, as developed by the legislatures and courts. Consideration will also be given to a variety of tactical, ethical, procedural and evidentiary issues as well as to questions of law reform. Tax implications of some situations will be discussed, but no background in this area is necessary. The psychological dynamics of matrimonial disputes will receive some attention as well. (To be offered jointly with LAW-520.) Four term hours.",
