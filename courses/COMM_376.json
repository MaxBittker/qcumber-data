The objective of this course is to identify such differences and to analyze and predict the influences of different economic forces and socio-political norms on international business operations and business decision-making in the region. Topics include: historical contexts, government-business relationships, inter-business networks, corporate governance, institutional and economic reforms, market competitions and business etiquettes. \u00a0",
