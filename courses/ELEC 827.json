        "description": "Study of multimedia information processing with particular focus on multimedia signal compression for communications and storage. Applications of multimedia compression functionalities abound, including point-to-point and multipoint communications over heterogenous networks (e.g. wireless and Internet networks), and multimedia content generation, distribution, and playback in consumer and commercial products and services. Course topics include: major lossless and lossy compression techniques for coding speech, audio, image, video, and scanned documents; the latest multimedia standards, their compression, system, and transport layers; current research problems in multimedia communications such as scalable coding, transcoding, multiuser media streaming, error robustness and signal recovery. Three-term-hours; lectures. Permission of instructor. G. Chan.\u00a0\u00a0",
