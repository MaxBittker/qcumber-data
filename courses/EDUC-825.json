        "description": "An examination of how cognition is situated, embodied and mediated in human and more-than-human worlds rather than confined to individual minds. Situated cognition offers a dialectal perspective on human development whereby cultures provide the tools of human cognition while cognition and learning create cultures and selves. Sociohistorical, cultural, certain constructivist and/or other relevant psychological traditions are explored through studies of everyday activity and more formal educational situations.",
