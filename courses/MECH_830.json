        "description": "A review of measurement theory including: static and dynamic characteristics of signals, spectral analysis with filtering methodologies, response of systems, and statistical/uncertainty analyses. Subsequently the course then provides insight into traditional as well as contemporary measurement techniques in fluid dynamics ranging from single-point scalar/vector measurements through to spatially resolved volumetric reconstructions. To conclude, post-processing and data-manipulation strategies for such contemporary data sets along with a discussion of future concepts will be presented.",
