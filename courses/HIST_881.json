        "description": "Beginning from the creation of a concept of religious identity, as such, in the early Christian and Late Antique context, this course looks at the subsequent construction of an orthodox religious identity, and, in parallel, the establishment of dissidence as unorthodoxy in the Byzantine and East Mediterranean world to the fifteenth century. We examine the formation and the contested nature of the boundaries by which the Byzantines sought to define and separate religious others including early 'heretical' groups, Islam, and the Latin West. We then move on to consider the perhaps surprisingly insubstantial 'mirage' of the resulting orthodox identity through an investigation of the practices surrounding and attitudes towards such elements as monks, holy men, miracles, relics, icons, amulets, divination and sorcery in Byzantine society.",
