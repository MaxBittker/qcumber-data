        "description": "The expanding role of systematic knowledge in the social institutions and processes of the advanced societies is examined. The codification of data as information within computerized systems is analysed in terms of its social origins and consequences. The cultural implications of social reliance on science-and-technology and expert systems and the diffusion of information within more popular media are explored, with special reference to the concepts of reflexivity and globalization. Relevant theorists include Jurgen Habermas, Anthony Giddens, Jacques Ellul, Roland Robertson.",
