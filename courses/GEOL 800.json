Professional practice and ethical aspects will also be discussed. (2) Mathematical methods for Geosciences: will provide a foundation in numerical methods and mathematical analysis. Topics include spatial statistics, probability, linear regression, and an introduction to numerical modeling techniques. (3) Experimental/Analytical Techniques in Geosciences: will provide an overview of analytical techniques and equipment available to geoscientists. Intended as an introduction to more advanced methods modules, this last section will provide a fundamental knowledge of the theory and operation of instruments and techniques available to members of our department. .",
