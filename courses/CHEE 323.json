The design component of the course will require students to work in teams to develop three catalytic processes. These\r\nprojects from examples covered in class, and may include encapsulated enzyme bioreactors, catalytic distillation units, fluidized-bed olefin polymerization reactors and/or multi-phase olefin oligomerization processes.",
