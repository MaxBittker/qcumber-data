        "description": "The purpose of the course is to examine in detail the principal legal issues and considerations involved in a variety of key transactions and other events that typically arise for a substantial private or public corporation. The topics to be considered include: share attributes and other 'corporate governance' matters affecting the organization of more complicated corporate entities, debt financings (including the preparation and negotiation of loan agreements and dealings with financial institutions generally), insolvencies and restructurings, amalgamations, reorganizations and other 'fundamental changes' and various aspects of corporate acquisitions. Emphasis would also be placed upon the role and responsibilities of lawyers involved in corporate organizations and transactions, taking into account potential ethical and conflict of interest considerations, and practices that a lawyer may or should adopt to reflect these considerations and to best serve the client's interests. \r\nPREREQUISITE LAW -440 Business Associations",
