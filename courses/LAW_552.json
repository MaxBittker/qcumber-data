        "description": "Fiduciary Obligation will explore the rapid escalation to its current prominent status in modern Canadian jurisprudence. The course will trace the concept from its ancient origins in Equity to its ubiquitous presence in all areas of commercial, corporate, private and governmental law. Commencing with a discussion of the concept itself, the course will endeavour to deal with several distinct areas where the relationships have as their underpinnings a fiduciary duty: agent (real estate, stock brokers, promoters), solicitor-client, corporate (directors, officers, employees), private (clergy, teachers, family), governmental (aboriginal affairs, elected officials), etc. The course will conclude with an in depth discussion of the remarkable remedial power where the duty of utmost good faith applies and the courts' use of such equity-based power.",
