        "description": "This course presents the formulation and use of finite element models for the analysis of a broad range of non-linear solid materials (plastics, metals, elastomers) subject to large deformations. Basic concepts from continuum mechanics (suffix notation, large strain theory, constitutive relations) are covered in order to provide a basis for the formulation of these models and for the interpretation of results. Testing procedures for the determination of non-linear material properties, required for model input, are also covered. Example analyses are conducted with commercial non-linear finite element code. Three term-hours; lectures.\u00a0 I. Y. Kim.",
