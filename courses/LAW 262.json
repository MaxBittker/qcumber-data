        "description": "In the past decade or so, the Supreme Court of Canada has revised some of its jurisprudence on s. 2(b), s. 2 (d) and s. 15 of the Charter in a way that affects labour law in Canada. This course addresses this changes and thus will provide students interested in labour law an important set of tools for litigation and analysis. In addition, the course will be of interest to students interested in advanced constitutional law generally, as it addresses a right not typically discussed in first year constitutional law, namely freedom of association, and it allows for in-depth analysis of s. 15 and s. 2(b), beyond what may be addressed in a general constitutional law course.",
