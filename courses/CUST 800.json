        "description": "This course introduces students to the major theoretical schools that underpin and are elaborated by research in Cultural Studies, including: Marxism, feminism, postcolonial theory, critical race theory, structuralism, poststructuralism, psychoanalysis, and queer theory. As part of our engagement with these theories, we will explore key concepts in the field: culture, hegemony, deology, articulation, discourse, imperialism, globalization, cosmopolitanism, identity, subjectivity, the unconscious, the state, orientalism, and so on. Since there is no body of theory that defines Cultural Studies neatly or completely, readings, discussions, and assignments will focus on tracing the tangled and contested theoretical history and current state of the field. Three term-hours; Fall. S. Lord",
