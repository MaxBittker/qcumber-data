        "description": "This course provides an introduction to sensing and actuation in mechatronic systems. The topics include sensing principles for the measurement of motion, force, torque, pressure, flow, temperature using analog and digital transducers; actuating principles using for continuous drive actuators and stepper motors; power transmission systems; and methods for signal collection, conditioning and analysis. Various components will be experimentally tested and analyzed.",
