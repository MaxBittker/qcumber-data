        "description": "This course is intended to help students understand the basic issues of learning and teaching in engineering disciplines from a practical perspective. We will consider teaching practices which facilitate the development of knowledge, skills and professional attitudes in engineering students. We will explore all common forms of teaching e.g. laboratory classes, tutorials, lectures, project work as well as more innovative forms of teaching. Drawing on recent engineering education and education literature this course will be discussion based, with key weekly readings.\u00a0 Not offered 2007-08.",
