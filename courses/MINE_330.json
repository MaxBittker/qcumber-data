        "description": "This course for students in Mining Engineering and allied disciplines will apply basic principles of economic evaluation learned in APSCI 221 to the minerals industry. Topics covered include: the project definition and economic evaluation process; economic analysis tools and techniques; taxation; inflation; cost estimation; the nature of mineral supply and demand; mineral commodity markets\r\nand pricing; uncertainty and risks associated with the mining industry, their analysis and incorporation into the evaluation process. Assignments, examples, and tutorials reflect a variety of situations and challenges faced in the evaluation of\r\nexploration and mine development opportunities, as well as important applications to mining and mineral processing design and decision-making.",
