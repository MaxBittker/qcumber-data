        "description": "Current theories on the yielding and failure of normally consolidated and overconsolidated clays and granular materials are presented and discussed in lectures. The usefulness and limitations of critical state theory to predict soil behaviour is then evaluated against real soilbehaviour observed in triaxial tests. Additional advanced topics include: fracture, anisotropy, partial saturation, creep and cyclic loading.\u00a0 A seminar project is usually undertaken in this course. Three term-hours, (every second year beginning 2005-2006).\u00a0",
