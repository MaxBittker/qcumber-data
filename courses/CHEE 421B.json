Students will submit interim oral and written progress reports and a final oral presentation and technical report. They will be expected to present and defend their results in a conference/seminar setting. The projects may be concerned with engineering design and development work or may be of a more fundamental research nature. Students enrolling for this course are advised to consult with the faculty member concerned late in the winter term of their 3rd year of study.",
