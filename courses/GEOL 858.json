        "description": "A discussion of recent developments in the various isotopic/geochronological techniques, intended for graduate students with no previous background in geochronology. Topics discussed will include: nature of isotopes, theory of radioactive decay; the mathematics of diffusion and closure temperatures; error propagation and least-squares fitting; 40Ar/39Ar dating; interpretation of: 40Ar/39Ar age spectra, isochrons and correlation diagrams; U-Pb and Pb-Pb dating; other geochronological systems including Rb-Sr, Sm-Nd, Re-Os, Lu-Hf, U-Th-series disequilibrium, (U, Th)-He, and fission track; recent developments in geochronology.",
