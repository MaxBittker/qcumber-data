        "description": "Most organizations make or buy explicit predictions of the environment within which they expect to be operating. They serve as a basis for planning and control. These organizations are trying to identify, understand and influence changes that are occurring in the local, national and international economic, political and social environments, as well as in their own organization. The course examines the theoretical and historical origins of forecasting, and discusses the approaches used to make and assess predictions in the short- to medium-term. The emphasis is on the practical application of forecasting methods.",
