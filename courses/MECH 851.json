        "description": "This course covers the theory and practice of materials characterization by X-ray and electron microscopy techniques. Theory includes interaction of materials with X-rays and electrons, diffraction and image formation. The following topics are discussed and illustrated by laboratory investigations: determination of crystal structure, microchemical analysis, characterization of lattice defects, determination of texture and measurement of residual stresses. Three term-hours, lecture and laboratory; R. Holt.",
