        "description": "This course explores the geopolitical, cultural, racial, and gendered contexts of globalization in relation to education. Using the notion of the \"World-as-Text\", it critically analyzes generic notions such as global village, global education, global economy, ecology, and international development. The role of the teacher as critical thinker and cultural worker in the present global, social and political climate is probed. Eurocentric models of education, amelioration, globalism, internationalism, and progress, are deconstructed, while stereotypical constructions and categorizations of the World are examined and interrogated. Practices that promote educational and cultural equity are discussed as alternatives. R. Rees.",
