Topics covered are orthographic projection, isometric sketching, auxiliary and section views as well as dimensioning and working drawings.\u00a0 Computer-aided design software is used to create solid models of the parts and assemblies as well as to generate dimensioned drawings.\u00a0 Students apply their learning in a project where they design their own version of a consumer product. Students learn by hands-on exercises in free-hand sketching and computer-based drawing.",
