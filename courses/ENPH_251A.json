The emphasis is on correct measurement techniques, treatment of results and the presentation of data. Error and uncertainties in experimental measurement, the propagation of errors. Probability and the Binomial, Poisson and Gaussian distribution functions, fitting of Poisson and Gaussian distributions to a sample population. Linear least squares fit, chi-squared.\u00a0",
