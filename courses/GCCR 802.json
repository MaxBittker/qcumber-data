It familiarizes students with the \"people centered\" CD method. It introduces concepts of \"community\" and the basic elements and methods involved in developing a community profile. The critical role of \"dialogue\" in creating relationships and how it is approached and carried out is also explained and practiced. The course uses case studies and experiences drawn from the mining industry to illustrate and reinforce concepts and methodology.",
