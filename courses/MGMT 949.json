        "description": "Since the formal inception of the discipline in the early 1900s, marketing has changed and evolved. A number of questions have marked this evolution: What is the nature and scope of marketing? Is marketing an art or a science? What criteria should be used to judge the contributions of marketing as a discipline? This course will provide an overview of challenges posed by these questions. It will also trace the growth of the discipline and its responses to changes in the business environment.",
