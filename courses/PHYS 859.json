        "description": "A multi-disciplinary graduate course on the principles of microfabrication with research and industrial perspectives. It aims to help students from a broad range of Applied Sciences understand the global trend to miniaturize devices (microcircuits, transducers, displays) and to integrate them into microsystems. An ongoing articulation of generic principles is illustrated both within and beyond the mainstream microelectronics domain. Linkages to the emerging world of nanoscale fabrication are explored.",
