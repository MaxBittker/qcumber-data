The intention of the legislators who voted on it?\u00a0 Or perhaps other methods?\u00a0 Should the interpretation of statutes be different than that of the constitution, judicial decisions, or contracts?\u00a0 How do Canadian courts go about interpretation? In this introductory course we will explore the foundations of legal and statutory interpretation, in a way that would be both useful for the practicing lawyer and for those interested in the conceptual relationship between law and language.",
