Once selected for the course the students sign a contact outlining duties as well as personal learning and experiential objectives.\u00a0 The student will be evaluated by the professor on the same basis as a member of a professional services firm.\u00a0 Key performance attributes include technical skills such as analytical, writing and presentation skills as well as administration and project management effectiveness. Soft skills evaluated include engagement and contribution to the firm, leadership, team effectiveness/collaboration, professionalism and client relationships.\u00a0 Considerable emphasis is placed on the success of the client engagement as assessed by the professor through a formal client feedback and client satisfaction survey. Since this independent study is both project-and-client based, it is very rewarding, but demanding.\u00a0 Students will apply and improve skills related to delivery and management of professional services, and the integration of virtually all subject matter from previous courses.\u00a0 Students considering a career in consulting or professional service, with previous experience in managing projects, who enjoy interacting with business people, who thrive in fluid and ever-changing project cultures, who value the importance of fostering innovative or creative environments, are strongly encouraged to apply.",
