        "description": "The impact of ore estimation uncertainty on the mine planning process is examined. Deposits, including precious and base metals are discussed. Strategic mine planning will be studied including: the impacts of regulatory, financial and other constraints on mine optimization; methodologies for determining planning inputs; the role of traditional and emerging algorithms for pit limit analysis and mine scheduling; and, techniques for planning under uncertainty. Students will develop a strategic mine plan for a mineral deposit. The focus will be on surface mining activities, however, the principles are applicable to underground mining.\r\nThree term-hours, winter term; lectures and laboratory. U. Thorley",
