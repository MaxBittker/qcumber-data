    description: "This course provides an introduction to the signaling pathways that regulate key cellular functions such as growth and motility.  The biochemical and structural principles that underlie the regulation of enzyme and protein activity in cells are emphasized.  Topics include protein kinases and phosphatases, ubiquitin modification, G-protein-coupled receptors, growth factor receptors, scaffold and adaptor proteins, Ras GTPases, phospholipases, oncogenes, cyclic nucleotides, phosphoinositides, isoprenoids and steroid hormones.  Offered jointly with BCHM 432. Three lecture hours per week. Fall; G.P. Côté.  PREREQUISITE: BCHM 310, or BCHM 315 and BCHM 316 and BCHM 317 for BCHM students; BCHM 310, or BCHM 315 and BCHM 316 for LISC students (or equivalent).   EXCLUSION: BCHM 432, BCHM 431, BCHM 433, BCHM- 831*, BCHM-832*, BCHM 833*, BMED-831*."
