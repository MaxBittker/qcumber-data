    description: "Time-varying operation of chemical and biochemical processes is introduced. Dynamic mathematical models are formulated using material and energy balances. Effects of operational and design parameters on steady-state and dynamic operations are investigated. Numerical techniques are introduced to solve systems of algebraic and differential equations. Numerical and symbolic computation tools are used to analyze dynamic and steady-state process behaviour."
