  basic: 
    description: "Applications of the principles of brittle and ductile deformation to the fabric analysis of rocks in the optimization of strategies for open-ended resource exploration, resource engineering, continental tectonics studies, and geotechnical engineering problems. Emphasis is on fracture, fault, and vein analysis; structures in fold and thrust belts and continental collision zones; and studies of superposed deformation and their impact on effective and economical mineral resource development.\nNOTE    This course may not be offered every year.
