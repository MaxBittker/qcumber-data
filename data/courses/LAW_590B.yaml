    description: "Queen's Legal Aid provides legal assistance to low-income area residents and to students at Queen's University and St. Lawrence College.  It also provides litigation experience before various decision-makers to law students, helping them develop skill and confidence as legal professionals.  Operating largely as a poverty law clinic, Queen's Legal Aid typically assists with criminal and quasi-criminal offences, landlord/tenant disputes, creditor/debtor matters, employment claims and income maintenance problems.  \r\nUnder close supervision by clinic lawyers, law students interview and counsel clients, research legal issues, draft legal memoranda, provide legal opinions, prepare pleadings, negotiate settlements and participate in trials before criminal and civil courts, as well as hearings before administrative tribunals.  Approximately eighty students work on clients' files during the academic year.  Eighteen can register for Clinical Litigation Practice (LAW-590) and carry significant client service responsibilities for academic credit.  Credit students have weekly classes involving lectures, exercises and seminars.  Topics covered include: advocacy in trials and hearings, interviewing and counselling, file management, legal ethics, legal research and writing, negotiation and settlement, office procedures, professional responsibility and solicitor/client relationships.  Students in LAW-590 are expected to participate in weekly classes, present a short seminar and also attend weekly meetings with colleagues and weekly meetings with clinic lawyers.Students interested in this course should refer to information about the clinic in the Queen's Legal Aid chapter, and discuss any potential conflict of interest with the senior clinic lawyer.
