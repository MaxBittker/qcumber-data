    description: "This course develops an understanding of the behaviour of piezoelectric and electrostrictive ceramic materials with particular reference to their use in electromechanical transducers. The properties of other electromechanical transduction materials such as piezoelectric polymers and composites, magnetostrictive materials and shape memory alloys will also be discussed briefly. The use of these materials in acoustic transducers for particular applications such as sonar, ceramic motors and actuators, active control of position, shape and vibrations, and smart structures will be reviewed. Other types of functional ceramic materials will be discussed briefly and these will include conducting, dielectric, electro-optical, magnetic and superconducting ceramics. This course will be cross-listed at RMC and at Queen's University. Three term-hours, lectures."
