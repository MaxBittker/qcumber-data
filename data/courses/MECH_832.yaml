    description: "This course begins with a thorough review of the fundamental principles of combustion such as heat of reaction, chemical equilibrium, and chemical kinetics.  Combustion aspects related to explosion phenomena such as flame acceleration, detonation wave and blast wave propagation are then covered.  Finally, the single degree-of-freedom response of mechanical structures to blast wave loading will be discussed, and explosion damage mitigation techniques will be presented.  Three term-hours, lectures.  G. Ciccarelli"
