    description: "In this course, we discuss methods for knowledge discovery and predictive analysis using very large data sets (for example, click-stream and social network data).  The course surveys statistical and machine learning techniques appropriate for different types of data as well as key technologies and applications that are driving the big data revolution.  We contrast traditional and emerging NoSQL database technologies (e.g. SQL versus the MapReduce framework) and examine how Big Data affects interactions with IT departments within organizations.  The course also provides a foundation for using predictive models in data-driven decision making."
