    description: "Business ethics is increasingly important as expectations of corporate social responsibility keep rising, as do negative consequences for failing those expectations.  Public, institutional, regulatory and government pressures mean decisions on business ethics can now determine corporate and career survival.  This advance course on business ethics builds on the introductory Business Ethics and Corporate Social Responsibility course in second year and is a credit toward the Certificate in Corporate Social Responsibility.  It is intended to produce capability and commitment in a new core competence for future managers.  The course will go into depth in critical areas such as professional ethics, moral standards, stakeholder management, decision models and designing ethics programs to achieve an ethical workplace and corporate social responsibility objectives.  A number of critical issues will be explored in depth."
