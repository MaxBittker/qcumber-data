    description: "Monetary obligations, including debts for borrowed money, the payment of the price of goods or services, the award of damages for breach of legal duties or the imposition of fines, are central to commerce and the enforcement of almost all obligations in our legal system.  The effective enforcement of these debts is fundamental to the rule of law.  This course will explore such enforcement when the obligor either does not or cannot pay the debt. Remedies available to judgment creditors and to secured and unsecured creditors against a defaulting debtor and the rights and obligations of both creditors and debtors in those processes will be explored.  The course includes the enforcement of judgments and a summary introduction to secured lending transactions. The basic principles of personal and corporate bankruptcy, including the public policies advanced by the bankruptcy process, preferences and debtor rehabilitation and discharge, are presented.  The course addresses priorities among creditors, including tax claims by the state.  The restructuring of insolvent businesses using proposals under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act or plans of arrangement under the Companies Creditors Arrangement Act is introduced.  Professional ethics issues in these matters will be addressed."
