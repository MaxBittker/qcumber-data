    description: "This course discusses contemporary debates about the obligation of persons in wealthy countries to alleviate poverty among those in the developing world. The course addresses the proper currency of global justice, the source of the obligation of the rich and poor, and examines the criticisms that have been made. These inquiries require examining anew the basis of the nation state in the international order and the extent to which people are morally required to help those who are not fellow citizens."
