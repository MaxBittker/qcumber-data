    description: "The goal is to develop a critical understanding of the implications for children's educational experiences of the effects of social class background, sex/gender differences and racial background by focusing on three questions: How is school experience affected by the cultural context of children's lives? How do schools respond to real or imagined differences among students? How does the culture of the school, the attitudes and expectations of teachers, the concepts conveyed by the 'hidden' curriculum contribute to the way children experience school? A critical perspective is developed which teachers might use to better respond to the diversity of student needs."
