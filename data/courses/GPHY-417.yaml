    description: "Changes in land use and land cover represent significant changes to the dynamics of the earth system. This course will explore the methods used to quantify rates of land-use and land-cover change, and also the biophysical consequences of these changes. The goal of the course is to develop a framework for evaluating the biophysical and societal trade-offs associated with land-use decisions.\nNOTE    Field trip fees may apply in certain years."
