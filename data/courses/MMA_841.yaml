    description: "In this course, we explore analytical issues in manufacturing and service operations, with particular attention to global supply chains.  Specific concepts, decisions, and quantitative techniques commonly encountered in the management of operations and supply chains are emphasized.  Analytical methods are a linking theme, but we also study strategic and tactical perspectives and highlight the competitive advantages that effective and efficient operations can provide for an organization.  The interactions of operations with other business areas and with the environment are discussed along with how operations analysis can contribute to the achievement of organizational goals.\r\nThe course includes three modules: Controlling Operations Systems, Designing Operations Systems, and Integrating Operations Systems.  Class time focuses on the key analytical concepts of each topic, and on the applications of this material in decision making within the operations function."
