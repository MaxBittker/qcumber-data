    description: "Dicey wrote: \"One reason why the law of the constitution is imperfectly understood is that we too rarely put it side by side with the constitutional provisions of other countries. Here, as elsewhere, comparison is essential to recognition.\" The Constitution Act, 1867 declares the Constitution of Canada to be \"similar in principle\" to that of the United Kingdom. The guarantees of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms are subject to reasonable limits prescribed by law that can be justified in a \"free and democratic society.\" These statements beg further comparative questions about the nature of Canadian constitutionalism and political culture. Employing case law and commentary, we shall consider some of the major points of convergence and divergence in \"written\" and \"unwritten\" constitutional traditions, with reference to Canada, the UK, the United States, France, Australia, South Africa and other countries. We shall also examine the role of the courts in constitutional judicial review, and the extent to which fundamental principles such as the rule of law, democracy, equality and the protection of minorities are implemented. The objective of this seminar is to provide a broad understanding of the challenges facing constitutionalism and thus to encourage a closer examination of Canadian constitutional choices.Â  (To be offered jointly with LAW-221.) Three term-hours; Winter. W. Newman."
