    description: "The practicum consists of ten weeks of regular in-school practice as well as a three-week Alternative Practicum.  After an intensive orientation period at the Faculty of Education in September, Consecutive and final year Concurrent teacher candidates complete their teaching placement in selected Associate Schools.  The regular practicum is made up 6 weeks of teaching in the fall and 4 weeks of teaching in the winter term. The fall term teaching block is split into two 3-week components.  After the first practicum component candidates complete five weeks of classes then return to the same Associate Teacher/Department for the second component.  Candidates will normally return to the same Associate School to work in their other subject area for the third component of the practicum in the winter term.  The schools are selected from a number of District School Boards encompassing geographic areas that include Kingston, Peterborough, Toronto, Ottawa, Brockville, Belleville, Oshawa, Mississauga, and Waterloo.  Teacher candidates should be aware that they may be assigned to an Associate School outside their preferred area.  Please note that candidates are responsible for their own travel and accommodation costs.  During the practicum, candidates work closely with associate teachers, school personnel and faculty liaisons.  The Alternative Practicum starts after the third component of the practicum. The Alternative Practicum should relate to the candidate¿s Program Focus (FOCI) course.  Only candidates enrolled in the Outdoor and Experiential Education program will get experience in both teaching subjects in the fall term.  The OEE candidates will complete the third component of their practicum in an Ontario Outdoor or Experiential Education setting."
