    description: "An introduction to two subjects which together with MATH 401/3.0 provide an entry into discrete mathematics and its applications. Among the enumeration techniques covered are inclusion-exclusion, recurrence relations, and generating functions. The study of designs includes finite geometries and Latin squares. Given jointly with MATH 802/3.0.\nLEARNING HOURS    120 (36L;84P)\nRECOMMENDATION    Experience with abstract mathematics and mathematical proof, and a good foundation in linear algebra."
