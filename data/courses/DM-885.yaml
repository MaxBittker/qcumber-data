    description: "Advanced Project Management builds from the basic tools of project management to introduce participants to the reality of managing projects within the context of engineering organizations that can be complex, where multiple projects may be in place, where membership is drawn from a variety of specialization's and individual differences abound and where team-based functioning is the norm.  The course will address issues such as management of multiple projects, individual differences, project leadership, working in teams, and change management. Case studies of managed projects will be used in the course. (Lead Instructor:  Harvey Kolodny, Toronto)"
