    description: "Basic principles of litho- and aqueous-geochemistry. New principles involving stable and radiogenic isotope geochemistry will follow. The hydrologic cycle will be examined from a geochemical perspective, leading to discussion of hydrothermal fluids and ore deposits associated with hydrothermal alteration. Phase equilibrium, mineral stability, oxidation-reduction reactions, isotope geochemistry, and other characteristics of hydrothermal fluids. The origin and chemical compositions of magmatic and metamorphic fluids. (Portions of course given jointly with GEOL-465*.)"
