  basic: 
    description: "Four topics covering a range of self-assembled molecular systems will be discussed: monolayers and bilayers, block co-polymers, nanoparticles, and liquid crystals. Material properties, synthetic methods and application of these systems in current and emerging technologies, including nanotechnologies, will be covered. Offered Alternating years with ENCH 424 (CHEM 424)."
