    description: "Canada borders on three oceans and has the world's longest shoreline.  It possesses a continental shelf equivalent to 40% of its land mass.  Its maritime resources are huge and of fundamental importance to its future development.  In addition, Canada is a trading nation and relies on maritime transport for the import and export trade.  Its environmental security is dependent on the proper management of its coastal areas.  The course will generally address the UN Law of the Sea Convention, and the Canadian Oceans Act.  Specialized issues such as Canadian constitutional and administrative arrangements for the management  of marine areas and aboriginal rights in marine areas will be adverted to.  By way of introduction, the seminar will cover the principles and practice of the law of the sea, its history and instituitions, territorial sovereignty (including boundary definition), shipping, military uses of the sea, and the regulation of the  Polar Areas, international straits, piracy and the regulation of tanker traffic.  The protection of the marine environment from pollution will also be addressed, as will mining in the deep seabed.  A part of the seminar will focus on the Canadian contemporary continental shelf issues such as delimitation, laterally and outward, especially in the Artic."
