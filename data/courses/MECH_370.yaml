    description: "The basic mechanisms of mass transport and phase transformations in materials are developed from thermodynamic and kinetic principles.  Topics include phase equilibria, diffusion, solidification and solid-state transformations.  The application of these phenomena to materials processing methods, such as casting, forming, heat treatment and sintering is described. "
