    description: "Every civil litigator and private law solicitor should take this theoretically rich and practically useful course. Conflicts arise in every case that involves more than one province or more than one state. This course addresses: 1) whether a court has jurisdiction to decide a dispute; 2) when a court should decline to exercise jurisdiction; 3) what law applies to a dispute; and 4) whether a foreign judgment will be recognized and enforced. Examples may be drawn from all areas of private law, including torts, contracts, property, succession, and family law. The course will include a significant online component of lectures and exercises, as well as in-class discussions, problem-solving and exercises."
