    description: "What is the historical significance of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights?   Does the UDHR reflect a tradition of western values alien to other cultural traditions or does it have antecedents in many different cultures, antecedents that justify the use of the term 'universal?'  In this course these questions will be considered as will the possibility that the UDHR actually marks a new beginning, as much a challenge to traditional western values as it is to the values of other traditions.  These questions will be explored by examining the histories of the various rights and freedoms brought together in the UDHR. "
