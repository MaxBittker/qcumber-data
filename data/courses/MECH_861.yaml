    description: "This course examines experimental, analytical and numerical methods employed for evaluating and predicting forming limits in a variety of industrial metal forming operations. The concept of a forming limit diagram (FLD) is introduced and related to classical theories for plastic instability and failure. Constitutive equations of elastic-plastic flow are derived using a continuum mechanics approach, with additional discussion regarding issues of plastic anisotropy, damage accumulation, localization and material length scales. Three term-hours.Â  K. Pilkey."
