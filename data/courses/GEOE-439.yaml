    description: "Advanced theory and techniques for acquisition, processing and interpretation of geophysical data. Students solve a geophysical problem from the initial idea through strategy development, data acquisition, processing, to interpretation, communication and deliverables. Design projects will exploit seismic, gravity, magnetic, electromagnetic, geodetic and GPR techniques but the emphasis is on problem solving using integrated data from multiple methods/sources. Target areas include oil/gas/mineral exploration, near-surface prospecting and site investigation.Â  Processing will use both available and student designed software."
