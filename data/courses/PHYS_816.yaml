    description: "The Navier-Stokes equations and the magneto-hydrodynamic equations for compressible flow are reviewed briefly and discussed in terms of simple solutions. The theory of shock waves is presented and the important concept of 'self-similar flow' is introduced. These fundamentals are applied to the discussion of MHD wave propagation, gravitational collapse, stellar and galactic 'winds', supernovae, shock and ionization fronts in the interstellar medium."
