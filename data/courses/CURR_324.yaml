    description: "This course builds upon the foundation established in CURR323 as well as the experience candidates gained in the fall practicum.  Emphasis here is placed on a wide range of support resources and teaching methodologies which are explored using a variety of specialized guest speakers.  There is a strong emphasis on the cooperative development and sharing of curriculum ideas and resources within the class.  During this part of the course, there is usually an opportunity for candidates to sign up for an ¿optional¿ supplementary lab component providing hands-on experience in the use of GIS/GPS software and applications appropriate to grades 7-12.  The final section of the course consolidates and synthesizes the combined dimensions and experiences of CURR323 and CURR324."
