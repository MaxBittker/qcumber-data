Upon joining a lab, the student becomes a fully participating member of the research group, engaging in various research and research-related activities.  The rotations introduce students to many of the skills and concepts that they will use throughout their careers and provide a basis for the student's selection of a research area in which to perform dissertation research.  At the end of each rotation period students will be evaluated on oral/written presentations.Enrolment is limited.
