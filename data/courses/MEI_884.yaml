    description: "Design thinking is an important element of building effective business models for new entrepreneurial and intrapreneurial ventures. At the same time, design thinking lies at the heart of engineering, within the context of an understanding of the physical world around us. A convergence is emerging between the  design  approach   in  engineering,   and  the  design  approach   in  business   that  draws  from  an understanding of customers, markets and finance. This course is designed to provide to provide a foundation  for  design  thinking  in  both  contexts,  along  with  insights,  skills  and  tools  to  deploy  this important mindset effectively.  Instructors: Tim Bryant, James McLellan, Kim Woodhouse"
