    description: "Fundamental numerical algorithms and computational schemes will be introduced and applied to the solution of flows frequently encountered in the practice of hydraulic engineering. Topics covered include solution of non-linear equations; tridiagonal and block-tridiagonal systems of equations; solution of partial differential equations (finite difference schemes, control volume approach); grid generation. Applications to the determination of flow velocity and pressure fields of selected 1-D and 2-D laminar and turbulent open-channel flows will be considered. Three term-hours."
