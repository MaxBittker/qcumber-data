    description: "This course is intended to provide structural engineers with an in-depth understanding of the performance of reinforced, prestressed and composite concrete-steel structures under service conditions, including both the short and long term performances.  The course deals with the effects of creep and shrinkage of concrete, relaxation of prestressing steel, temperature, and settlement of supports on deflections, cracking and internal forces.  The displacement and force methods of analysis are used to account for these affects in calculating the deformations and time dependent forces and moments.  The course also covers the effects of construction and loading in different stages.  The course deals only with service conditions and doesn¿t deal with concrete structures at the ultimate stage or at failure.  Lecture based, 3 hrs/week."
