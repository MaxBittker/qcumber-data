    description: "This course examines the important factors in the design and operation of stirred tank bioreactors. A variety of biokinetic models are examined and used inÂ the design of ideal and non-ideal bioreactors. The effect of the rheology of fermentation broths on mass transfer, mixing, power requirement, etc. is considered, along with Residence Time Distribution Analysis as a tool for quantifying non-ideal behaviour. Novel fermentor designs and immobilized enzyme/cell systems are discussed. Scale-up criteria are examined. A.J. Daugulis"
