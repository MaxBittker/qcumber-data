    description: "The first half of the course will focus mainly on microeconomic issues related to land and labor markets in the agricultural sector, credit markets and insurance, and duality. In particular, it will consider alternative views of the role and endogenous evolution of non-market institutions in the development process. The second half of the course will deal with several macroeconomic issues including rural-urban migration, the interactions between inequality and economic development, the interactions between population growth and technical change, and the contribution of internal factor accumulation versus TFP growth. The course will conclude with a conference in which students are expected to present and discuss recent papers in development economics. Offered jointly with ECON-435."
