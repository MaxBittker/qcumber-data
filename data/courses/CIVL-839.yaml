    description: "This course will present a number of advanced approximate methods for analyzing structures. Topics covered  include: analysis of statically indeterminate trusses and frames; model analysis; energy principles; numerical integration for solving structural problems including Newmark¿s method and beams on elastic foundations;  structural vibrations including Rayleigh¿s principle, Stodola¿s iteration technique, and distributed mass systems using Newmark¿s method; structural stability including the energy criterion for stability, lower-bound methods, the method of  Vianello, columns with lateral  loads, Perry¿s approximation, the conjugate beam method, stability of unbraced frames and multi-storey building frames; plastic collapse of plane frames,  including the plastic moment of a cross-section, and limit theorems of plastic collapse; limit analysis of plates and slabs including the upper and lower bound methods, failure mechanisms, combined loading, and the strip method for slab design. Three term hours."
