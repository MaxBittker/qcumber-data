    description: "Negotiation is part of everyday life in organizations, whether negotiating with customers, clients, suppliers, co-workers or even the boss.  The purpose of this course is to introduce students to theory and research on negotiations with an emphasis on the social, behavioural, and decision-making processes.  Negotiations will be studied in a variety of settings ranging from simple buyer-seller negotiations to multi-party, multi-issue, cross-cultural negotiations.  In addition to the fundamentals of integrative and distributive bargaining, special topics may include ethics, gender, power, emotions, technology, and the use of agents.  The course also includes a practical component in that students participate in simulations, exercises, and case analysis designed to develop their negotiating skills as well as their understanding of negotiation processes."
