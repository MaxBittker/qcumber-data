    description: "This course surveys the acquisition and preparation of data for basic statistical analyses and presentation.  We survey both conventional and unconventional data sources including organized databases, online data capture, and point-of-sale data acquisition, and highlight challenges that each source can present.  The hazards of `data-fishing¿ will be emphasized ¿ a particular theme will be maintaining focus in data collection towards a specific problem requiring solution.  Topics will include formal and informal measurement methods, surveys, data screening and correction, and data summarization and presentation methods, followed by a review of statistical inference and regression modeling.  Parametric and non-parametric remedial measures for missing and censored data will also be studied."
