    description: "This optional Graduate Seminar will consider how legal scholars, lawyers and judges use social science research.  As the study of law and growth of legal scholarship becomes more inter-disciplinary and cross-disciplinary, the need to deal with social science material is increasing.  This course will have a mandatory component designed to teach students how to read, understand and work with the results of social science methodologies.  There will also be an optional component which will give students an opportunity to learn how to use basic statistical methods. Priority for enrollment will be given to LL.M. students, but a limited number of LL.B. students may be admitted.   (To be offered jointly with LAW-383). Not offered 2010-2011."
