The course combines theoretical understanding with practical application in four areas of communicative competence: reading, writing, listening, and speaking. Students will prepare and present a variety of messages and will be involved in the critical appraisal of the messages of others. (Lead Instructor:Â  Jennifer MacLennan, Western Ontario)"
