    description: "An examination of recent changes in the Canadian population and the social/spatial negotiation of citizenship. As Canadian society becomes more diverse, new concepts of citizenship and new developments in human rights provision counter historic forms of oppression ('race', class, gender), to result in changes that are mediated by public policy initiatives, citizenship movements, and the reorganization of capital. Key concepts: citizenship, multiculturalism, migration, racialization, gender, transnationalism, globalization, democracy. Three term-hours."
