    description: "The theory and use of numerical computational procedures to solve geo-engineering problems. The utility, significance and widespread applicability of analytical and numerical techniques will be illustrated in the evaluation and solution of practical problems. Methods for: solution of simultaneous linear equations, curve fitting, solution of the algebraic eigenvalue problem, interpolation, least-squares, error propagation and geostatistics are included."
