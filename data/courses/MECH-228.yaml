    description: "This course will cover the following topics in the field of dynamics.  Kinematics of particles: planar motion (rectilinear, curvilinear), choosing a coordinate system, conversions between systems, space curvilinear motion, free and constrained paths, relative motion between particles.  Plane kinematics of rigid bodies: absolute motion, relative motion (velocity and acceleration), instantaneous centre of zero velocity, motion relative to rotating axes.  Kinetics of systems of particles: generalized Newton's Second Law, work and energy, impulse and momentum, conservation of energy and momentum, impact."
