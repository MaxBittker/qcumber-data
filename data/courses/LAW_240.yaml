Once every two weeks, a legal, moral, or political philosopher will present a paper falling within the general boundaries of the Colloquium's ambit. In alternate weeks, students will meet with the Colloquium convenors to prepare for the forthcoming session, examining the paper in depth.Student evaluation will be a combination of participation (40%), six short reaction pieces (30%), and a term paper (30%). Participation will be evaluated by contributions during the seminar discussion in advance of the session with the author as well as engagement with the author during the session in which the author presents his or her paper."
