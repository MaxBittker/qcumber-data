============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Queens-Hacks/qcumber-data.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Queens-Hacks/qcumber-data)

Note: If you're looking for the easy to use course catalogue for Queen's University, you came close! This is the normalized filestructure database the powers it. You'll want to head over to http://qcumber.ca for the end-user site :)

Note also! Work in progress, not live yet. The current live site code is at http://github.com/ChrisCooper/QcumberD


This branch currently just a dump of data as json to get things rolling. To see how we intend to do things properly with yaml and schemas check out the [yaml branch](https://github.com/Queens-Hacks/qcumber-data/tree/yaml)
